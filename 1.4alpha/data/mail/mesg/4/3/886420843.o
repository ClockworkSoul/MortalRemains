mesg " This is illegal, there is no help to players from wizards, if youwant an area tested, you test it. If you want a weapon tested, you also test this. Giving weapons/armour/ anything else to a player gives oneor in this case as many as were there an unfair advantage. In response tothe fact thjat you were waiting for KNIFE to come back up, This gives me noexplination as to why you choose to. You are a wizard here, and are expectedto act as one, this means under no circumstances are you to do favors orlet a player run your area. I hope This clears it up. Yes I am unhappy, yesI don't like the fact that you did, your code dictates a warning, this is itI am glad that you mailed me, This I do appreciate, in the future, i wouldhope you will not make the same choice, if for no other reason than if ithappens again, i will have to delete your wizard. Thank you again for yourhonesty.    -Law_"
