mesg "ok heres some guns to code- MP5made by Heckler & Koch (H&K or HK)a cool gun, favored by police swat teams and a lot specialforces.  I've only seen it in 9mm and 45 ACP but im sure itcomes in other flavors too.  One of the cool features of itis that you have the option of shooting it in semi-auto(one shot per pull of the trigger), full-auto (pull the trigger once and hold it down to empty the magazine) or3 round burst (pull the trigger once and it fires 3 times).The 3 round burst is the favorite for most people.  It allowsyou to deliver a lot of lead but more accurately.  Becauseone of the drawbacks of full auto fire is that the gun tendsto either drift off target because of the recoil if its ahand held gun or the barrel gets heated up if youve gota tripod or permenantly mounted machine gun.  I think thesenever mind ...  They are kinda strange lookin guns.  Theycan be held one handed or two handed.  The clip serves asa front handle.  wish i could come up with a better desc for ya.they are also usually used with a strap that allows theshooter the bring the weapon up at almost arms length away,this is sposed to provide better stability and control, but ive never had a chance to try it.  That strap is also usedfor a lot of other full-auto guns but im pretty sureHK were the ones who invented it.BTW, the 9mm and 45 acp are both pistol rounds, thatsall the mp5 shoots, pistol rounds.AK-47The ultimate battle rifle.  Invented by a guy namedkalishnakov (andre i think).  He is a general in therussian army (do they still have an army).  Well actuallyhes retired.  The funny thing is, his design is the mostprolific gun design in the world, by a large margin, andhe lives in near poverty in russia.  As i said there are moreAK and AK clones than any other gun oin the world.  Most ofthem are made by the chinese, but those are cheap guns.  The best AKs are the ones made in russia.  90% or more ofthe AKs shoot 7.62 X 39 cartridges.  Those are 30 calrounds that arent really powerful but they are perfectfor battle.  The maximum range for one of these whenyer hunting is about 75 maybe 100 yds.  The maximumrange it can kill a person is about 300 yards, but itsnot accurate beyond 100.  As a comparison, the M14, which the nato 30 cal round is effective for hunting out to300 yards, and can still kill a man at 1000 yards.The M16, which shoots a 223 has about teh same rangesas the M14.  AK's are legendary for thier reliability.They can digest any kind of corroded or dented or whateverammunition you can feed it.  I have heard from guys whowere in vietnam that you could take a round that wasso corroded you had to chip some of it off b4 it wouldchamber and it would still function perfectly.  The M16samericans were using were completely opposite, and bitof calcium or anything else on a round would causea malfunction or a jam.  Also, 7.62 X 39 ammo is supercheap.  These guns can be fired in semi-auto orfull-auto.oh yeah, this gun is a rifle, its shot 2 handed usually, butits short enough to be used 1 handed.  There are a fewother rounds it has been made in, but i cant remember themright now, but they were all rifle rounds.Tommy Gun : or Thompson Submachine Gunthe gun that made the 20's roar.  You saw a documentaryon it so you know a lot of it already.  It was inventedby a guy named thompson, he was a military man.  He mdethe gun for the military around WWII but it wasnt usedat all until korea by the military.  And as u know itwas a favorite of gangsters, it would prolly be myfavorite too.  It shoots 45 ACP, a pistol round.  Ive never heard of it coming in any other caliber.  Its a2 handed gun but can be used 1 handed too.  the coolestthing about them is thier 500 round drums.  It shootsfull auto only as far as i know.M16Called the black rifle, the current issue rifle ofthe Us armed forces.  Invented by a fella namedStoner.  Stoner also invented a few other guns, the onei like the best is the SR-25.  It's exactly like the m16 butbigger, where a m16 shoots a .223 or (5.56 Nato) the SR-25shoots a .308 (or 7.62 Nato).  These guns have carrying handlesthat give them thier distinctive look.  The first of theserifles that were carried by our troops into vietnam werenotorious for jamming and being generally unreliable.  the curreent versions are not near as bad but still somewhati mean still not as reliable as an AK-47.  lesse, therenah ... umm they are superlightweight as is thier ammo.one of the biggest reasons for the Us military switchingover to it.  Troops can carry more ammo.  There are also stories (which i happen to belive) that they switchedfrom the big .308 to the light .223 because the .223was less lethal than a .308.  Thier thinking was thatif you shoot an enemy soldier and he died, then thatsit, you've takne out one of thier guys.  But if youshoot an enemy and he is only injured, leg blown offwahtever, then you take 3 enemies out of action, theguy you shot and 2 more to carry him to a hospital.ok yer here now, more later"
