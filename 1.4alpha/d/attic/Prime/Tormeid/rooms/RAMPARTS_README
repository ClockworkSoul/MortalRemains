The ramparts were mostly constructed with my mass-construction program..

They form the outside of the castle wall..

15 rampart rooms each way.  That makes the castle.. 17 by 17.
This means there are a potential of 289 rooms PER FLOOR.
FUCK.

Oh yeah.  They don't fucking go in sequential order all the way around.
I accidentally made too many on a couple of the sides..and later fixed them.
Players won't notice, I promise.
