The fact is that he bought the platemail seven times, and none of the times it appeared in his inventory. He ran out of money trying to buy it. I went there and snppoed him with some credits I gave him to try it again, and I saw it was true. The shop purchased the sale, but his inventory was empty. He asked me to be his witness for this bug he already reported. Well, I'm letting you know what I saw, and what I did. Thanks again for your time hon :)> Lady Nsd> FOund the prob, and fixed it.
