mesg "Hi honey;Finally Cyanide gave me an example file of a monster that blocks the way.The code is not made in the monster, but in the room. Check this file, and use it as reference; /u/n/nsd/lust/mare7.cI won't be online tonight, for the disgusting PMS has visited me. I feel terrible, so I'm going to sleep early. Hope that file serves you for your purposes.Gonna miss ya. Perhaps we can meet tomorrow night. Big Kiss to ya, babe!!Yours;Lady NSD"
