mesg "this is one of kyako's test characterswhy was he nuked?i need to talk to an admin to find out that whas going onthis is what happened as i see it1. Kyako used evals to remove invisibilty from other wizards and adminhowever, he/I talked with cyanide and this no longer occurd.2.Kyako used evals to try to kill darkangelVery IMPORTANT:Kyako had Darkangel's permission to try to kill him.Chronos was a witness to this co you can ask him3. Rehnbi is no longer a wizardI do not know why he was dewizzed also, buthe did not do anything wrong so i do not understand why he was dewizzedhe has told me many times that he specifically tries to be goodIf this mail angers any admin, please do not nuke this character, because it is only a player that i am trying to play the mud with.-kyako"
