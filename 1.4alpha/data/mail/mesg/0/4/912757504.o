mesg "he has every right top play here, just as you doI must point out that in my note posted, I stated that we willhave nothing to do with player killing, and the fact that youhave chosen to publically ask me to not allow him to play here, well basically it pisses me off. If your mad at him, or if he pisses you off then kill him, but leave that to the players. personallyI feel I have better things to do (like maintaining a mud) than to listento a player piss and moan on a board about another player. You mightsay to yourself, Nightmask is a dick, and I agree with youhere's the deal, This is your warning, You post another note on the boardcomplaining about a player, or anything like that, I will remove youThank you for your understanding  -Nightmask admin of Law_"
