sometimes when im killin these 3 guys, the last one keeps attacking me
and i do not attack him.  The only way i can kill him is to
keep casting spells at him, and naming him a the target.

the cash or the items i was carying. Alyson wont reset and It seems to be a

I loged off and then back on and the cop bots are still hunting me. i didnt want
to fight them and I dont think that this is right. 
Is this the way that things are supposed to happen? Even if a player logs off
the monsters or what ever still hunt you? Or are Cop Bots just auto attack

I think the error was because the doors were open the indicator changed to 3

i hope u got all that.

kinda wierd, i was trying out that new gun ...from what i could tell, when i
attacked killer, my foresight spell fired off twice, then i started hitting
killer and he couldnt hit back.  I'll test some more to see if this is a reproducable
bug with foresight.

cause lemme tell you, if it is, i feel tiamat may not be longed for this world!

Hoss at Sat Mar  4 04:51:31 2000 in /d/Planar/Baator/minauros/city15
ok, did more research on the bug from earlier.

it appears to be from foresight.

if i have foresight active and attack anything, foresight tries to fire off twice
and the monster cant hit me, while i am able to attack him. 

If I cast a spell on him, he will start to attack me again.
I think fi i command my pet to attack, he will attack the pet and when hes done
with the pet he will attack me.

also, if i leave the room and come back, he doesnt attack me.

dude, im dyin here, i wanna abuse this soooo bad and kill tiamat.  But, i know 
thats uncool, its not how i do business.  Here's how i do bidness, ive 
reported this bug .... now all i got to do is wait for u to log on at least once
then i can use the hell outta it till u get it fixed.  
as of mudtime mar 4 4:50:09 2000

Hoss at Sat Mar  4 04:59:57 2000 in /d/Planar/Baator/minauros/city15
for the record .. heres how i think foresight should work, this should
fix the aforementioned bug.  I think it should only fire off
when you are attacked.  Its kinda lame the way it works now.  I mean think aboiut it,
its supposed to be a protection from pk, and if i was going to pk someone, id prolly
wait till they were killing a monster or right after they wimpied from one.  In
that instance, foresight wouldnt do ya a dam bit of good.  It would even be allright
if it only fired off in pk, so the shadow warriors autoing me when i walk in wouldnt
set it off.


ok lesse now, i need 3 mil to level ... tiamat is worth 200k ... so id need to kill
her 15 times.  Holy geez thats gunna take forever with no spells.  I bet my
weapons wont even hit her, but rest assured i will find a way.  

Oh scuze me, my mind was wandering, ignore that last part

ok, i dont think its a bug, but i better report it just in case.  Actually i
see it more as a 'work around' than anything else, so this is more of an FYI
but anyway, i can get to the sanctuary with the ancient gold ring even from
the macrosoft building.  And then teleport wherever i want from there.
Personally, i think u should just leave this, soince there are only 3 charges
in the ring and its not really all that east to get, and in fact im pretty sure
im the only one who even knows where it is, and i dont tell people where
the secret stuff is.  But, i had to report it to keep my conciense clear.

this is, in my opinion, a rather large bug.  I was testing it out last night

when i use the 'attackall' feature for fighters with serena, I am basically
stunning myself for 4 or 5 rounds. This renders me useless in melee against her
until the duration of the attack wears off.  Could someone look into this please?
thanks

in my 'skills
 list "iron Will" is only listed as 1 non weapon slot, however in the
guild itis listed as 2 slots.  Which is correct?
