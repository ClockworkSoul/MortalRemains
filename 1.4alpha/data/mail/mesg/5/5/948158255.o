mesg "Hi Nemar;Right now I'm finishing the code in my nazi rooms. I'll only be able to stay til 10:00 pm tonight. In case I don't get to see you, know that I really appreciate all the help you're giving me. And I wanna tell you something else;You're the first mud-spouse that doesn't run away from me after the third encounter *grins evilly*. Hope we can still be together, to code and all else...I really enjoy mudding with you. See ya soon!Yours;Lady NSD"
