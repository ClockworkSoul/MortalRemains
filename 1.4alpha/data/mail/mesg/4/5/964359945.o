mesg "Couple questions:How do you think the combat should work.. I have it set up to have roundswhere you fight creatures of progressing difficulty.  Should there be a breakin between, or should it be just a how-long-can-you-last-thing?  I'm leaningtowards the how-long-can you live thing myself..How should I go about making the arena area echo it's messages to the oobservation room?  That's gonna be how people can watch the action withoutbeing in the actual room..What's actually done now:  The daemon now has a functioning ranking system.  The daemon will produce a random opponent from a data file for each round.  The daemon retains the rankings even through reboots.~chronos/thunderdome is where I'm hiding the files.Need some input..-C."
