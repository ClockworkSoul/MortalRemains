Ogres are great brutes standing more than nine feet tall, with thick 
torsos, heavy limbs, stringy hair, and warty hides. They are usually 
ill-tempered beings who enjoy violence for its own sake, indulging in all
manner of cruelty to entertain themselves. 

Ogres are extremely strong and hardy, but their lack of mental prowess is
the stuff of legend. They have a +2 bonus to both Strength and 
Constitution, but suffer a -2 penalty to Intelligence and Charisma.
