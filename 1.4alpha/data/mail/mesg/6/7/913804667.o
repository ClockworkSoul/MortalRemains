mesg "Good nite all and sionara.To Cyanide: Nothing personal dude and no hard feelings,i realize that our vision of the mud has diverged. I want a placewhere i can kick back code a few lines, have some fun and laughat all the little bugs. The plays the thing, so they say.I zipped the mud up for you, so download and do withit as you willAnd keep my code , i have no especial attachment to it anyway.(seeing as how its all second rate and such). If people are havingfun with it, then i am happy. Since this is more than a game to you,it's worth more to you than to me. When a game i play ceases to beenjoyable, i stop playing it. Nuff said.To Nightmask: When the new Mutara nukes you for having some fun, why dont you join my D&D campaign. (I wont even ask you to puta header on your character sheet if you dont want).To Darkangel: Remember that it is Cyanide's mud now. Not yours or anybodyelses. Oh, and take a mage, i heard they rip. (since you wont be codinglong after i leave)To Driver: At least you understood me. You and i both know that there isno carriage return in unix and there didnt have to be in any of my fileseither. You were always there to back me up, Saying, heh, updated and loaded.(sloppy yes, but did it ever care?). It just said, chuck, your code worked and that is good enough for me.I will not be logging in after this point, so any mail you send to thischaracter will not be read. In one week the account will be deleted,so if you want a copy of the mud, its in the keeper/home/mud dir."
