THanks

im in a library and obvious exits are south, east, and north, but I cant go north. It
gives another error for call_other() couldn't find object.

Just FYI.

The cats that auto wont die. They will however keep killing you and i have
died twice because of it. Not too happy about the deaths. and Im thinking that
there is a bigger bug at work here than just in this area.

Thanks

I think these frost guards should have some kind of equpment
that they use... Some of em have a combat description
that talks about an Ice axe or an ice sword ....

Just a thought

There's something wrong with the behirs when summoned. they don't always follow, and they don't take commands.
