	* Just checked this changelog, i think moby and i fixed contents 
	both while merging the lib ? :)

	* I think I fixed contents at some point, so I added a header ;)

	* Added ({}) around the ob's in contents.c  Still buggy though 
	(see runtime) 

Mon Nov 28 23:51:05 1994   And if I don't, what then?   (Mobydick at 192.52.218.45)

	* on line 32, and again 10 or 12 lines later, change -= ob to -= 
	({ ob })  Should help.

	* Fixed compat_object although it's prob obsolete

	* /std/object/ob_logic.c: added a resolv_path() call, as the 
	debug.log was showing ~/workroom as a destination (the move 
	failing of course)

	* /std/object/ob_logic.c: added check to see if 
          object is being moved to the same place (to/inside itself)

Mon Sep  6 14:40:16 1993   Adam Beeman   (Buddha at pobre.UCSC.EDU)

	* Made set() in prop.c nomask. This should have been this way all 
	along, IMHO. The thought that it wasn't is a chilling one.
