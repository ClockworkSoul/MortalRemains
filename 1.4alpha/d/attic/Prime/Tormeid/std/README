// When certain code keeps reappearing in rooms over and over again...
// I (Chronos) get tired of typing it all out and all this other bullshit.
// Not only that.. but what if I wanna make a change to all these fuckin
// rooms with the same code over and over again.. Easier to inherit a single
// file and save memory and time.  

Here's the inheritables I've made:
----------------------------------
guard.c - This file contains all the standard code for guards.
wg_room.c - This file is just a inheritable room that automatically clones 
            and keeps track of wandering guards.
family_room.c - This room clones and maintains a basic family for the
                castle guards' family areas.
