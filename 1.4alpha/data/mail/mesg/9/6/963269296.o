I am on now but I don't think I am going to be on later..I got maybe an hour and 1/2 sleep last night.. if that... just when I logged off Gregory woke upwanting to watch that damn elmo... I am sorry dear.... but If I do get on it will not be for long... I hope to see you before I log off though... If I don't see you before I log off then I will see you tomorrow night sometime.. because I know you have to start a class or something tomorrow... But I am thinking about you... *hugs*"
