mesg "I've re-read your text.  Now, I have a few questions.1) Where would my area be placed?  I was assuming western.2) what must I change in my area to make it \"conform\" to your ideas?Now, a few statements.....please do not fly off the handle...these are justrants.1) I don't like the fact that the entire arctic is now, for the most part,mapped out, and known.  I may as well delete the thoughts of a Steam poweredtown and a dragon cave/mountain from my mind.  I don't like having my creativity curbed.2)Actually, this is a question....is there ANY technology up here?  I mean,players are going to be coming up here with guns, lasers, body containmentarmor, etc.3) Now, I realize you say you can be \"picky\", but, being too \"picky\" can and willdestroy our area.  I've been here just as long as you, and you know I'm herefor the long haul, and I'm just as dedicated to making this game fun to play,but being too \"picky\" is going to 1)Slow us down, to the point of never finishing, 2) Create some tension that, frankly, I don't need.  This is NOT a job, sodon't look at it as one.  We are all here to enjoy what we have created, and see others enjoy them as well.  That's it, end of rant.Sebastian, your humble neo."
