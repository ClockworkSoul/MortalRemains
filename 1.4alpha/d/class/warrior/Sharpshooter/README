Since we have guns here, I figure it would be a neat Idea to give
players the option to specialize in the usage of them. This class
will give a player a few extra abilities. A high level Sharpshooter
will be able to hit monsters that normally need + weapons to be hurt,
this will advance with level, most likly up to a maximum of 4. Other
abilities are still in the works. When I decide on them, I will
add them to this file.
