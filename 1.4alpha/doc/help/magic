Players may learn to cast spells only be joining a class in
which spells are offered, most notable the mage or priest
classes, though there are others that offer spells to a losser
degree.

The command to cast spells tends to vary from class to class,
but is most often 'cast'.

Spells tend to follow the format:
   
            cast missile at target

Note, while already in combat, the current attacker is   
considered the default target, so simply typing 'cast <spell>'
will suffice.
