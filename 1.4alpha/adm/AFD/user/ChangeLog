them looks at their history bugffer.

	* /std/user/history.c: commented out Moby's admin check as it's 
	not working .. and ^^ history handling was broken 

Wed Aug 17 19:27:33 1994   Anthon Pang   (Robocoder at actlab.rtf.utexas.edu)

	* /std/user/history.c: no change here... I moved the broken 
	version back

	* /std/user/tsh.c: getting some unusual errors with passing -1 to 
	sscanf()... should be fixed now. 

Fri May 20 01:50:41 1994   GD Hack II   (Inspiral at mulberry.wustl.edu)

	* /std/user/tsh.c: Added a hardcoded override for the passwd 
	command. This should prevent wizards from making 
	"password-faker" objects. 

Sun May  8 15:01:41 1994   Anthon Pang   (Robocoder at annex1.net.ubc.ca)

	* /std/user/tsh.c: changed this_player() to this_object() in 
	prompt conversion ($D to "cwd") as it was causing problems for 
	shadow shell users (Error in call out) 

Sun May  8 05:22:51 1994   Anthon Pang   (Robocoder at mindlink.bc.ca)

	* /std/user/autoload.c: added file_size() check, and split 
	catch()'s in if () expression to separate lines (so that 
	debug.log can identify which error was caught) 

Sat Aug 28 00:47:20 1993   Douglas Reay   (Pallando at 129.10.10.20)

Sun Aug  1 14:30:18 1993   Anthon Pang   (Robocoder at keats.rick.cs.ubc.ca)

	* Minor fix to history.c; checks previous_object() != 0 before 
	doing geteuid() on it 

Fri Jul 30 08:40:35 1993   Tony Brannigan   (Grendel at black.ox.ac.uk)

	* Moved the following files to /std/attic: bitflags.c~ history.c~
