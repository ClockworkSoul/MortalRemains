I'll re-link your area right now.COncerning your request for lordship - I'll consider it on a fewgrounds:1 - You do what you can to actively recruit wizards and player to    the MUD. We could use the help.2 - You make an active effort to learn as much of the lib as     possible. Try new things. Experiment with code.3 - When I do lord you, you submit a proposal regarding your     future plans for the Arctic domain. What subareas will it    contain? When you're lorded you'll have the authority to add people to the Arcticdomain and give and remove access to areas.You'll be responsible for the actions of coders under you, andfor the quality of their work... it's alot of responsibility.I'm sure you'll do very well, though. :)-Cy-Sleep: A completely inadequate substitute for caffeine."
