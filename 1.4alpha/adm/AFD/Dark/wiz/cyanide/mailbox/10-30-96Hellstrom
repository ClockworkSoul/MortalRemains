==================================
Cy
just wanted to give you list of projects that i am working on...
first i have a newbie area open and ready to rock and roll...with the exception of 
the item that the newbies will recieve to make money off of the area...(approximatly 50 coins per kill)
second i have the main area of my city coded. I have a lot of work to do on my castle overall but will have it ready to go in a short time..
As to shops i have quite a few that i am trying to work on however..do to the fact that 
the standard pub still has glitches i can not incorporate them to there full extent yet
but i am working on portable heals for my pub and portable food, and waiting
for the option of non portable heals for lower prices. 
This should be available as soon as the standard pub is ready
i already have my files transfered to the area
in the dir /d/Light/area/elfland/
in this dir i have several sub dirs, Forest is the main entrance to the area,
castle is the city itself, fields is the newbie area, fair will be a midlevel monster area
with games and things for players to play and win (or loose) money...
Lake area is non monster area that will have boats and the possibility of fishing..
clouds is part of a quest sequence but have not begun that area in planning
I do plan on working on subareas of my area after the game opens
but i also need to design out my quest to do so, this will take a little bit of time
but i hope to have it coded and waiting for your approval around feb
i can have the rest of my area ready to go, with in a few weeks.
will keep you informed on the progress.
