Skills are an important part of this mud and are used for everything from
enhancing combat ability (ambidexterity, iron will) to brewing your own 
beer (brewing).

Skills (also sometimes called "proficiencies") are divided into two types:
Weapon Skills, and Non-Weapon Skills, which deal with a player's skill in 
weapons and a player's various other skills, respectively.

Each class is given a specific number of "skill slots" when they join a 
class, and then get an additional slot every few levels (the exact number
of levels varies from 3 to 6, and varies by class and skill type). Players
with exceptional intelligence are awarded with additional non-weapon skill
slots at their creation.

Weapon skills are exclusively taught in the College Martial Center. 
Different classes may learn to use different types of weapons, and may 
achieve different levels of skill by learning a weapon skill multiple 
times. The ranks of weapon skills go as follows:

            0 - Completely unskilled / Nonproficient
            1 - Proficient / Basically skilled
            2 - Expert
            3 - Master
            4 - High Master
            5 - Grand Mastery

Non-Weapon skills may be learned in one of two places: the College (also 
where weapon skills are learned) or your classhall. Non weapon skills, with
few exceptions are not possible to 'relearn' for a skill bonus.
