*********Ode to Cataclysm****************
Never as sweet a word is uttered, curled within a dream
Your name sings to me in angelic tones, a quiet, blessed stream
In your eyes I see, my heats desire, encased within a wish
To touch your face, or hear your breath, a moment of total bliss
These hands were created to hold your air, to mop your troubled tears
I find myself empowered by your touch, a loss of all my fears
To dance a dance with you alone, is worth a thousand years
I say to thee, my hearts desire, you set my world aflame
With one graceful move of your hand, the world is yours to tame
A minute is an hour, a second in time, matters not or so it seems
Sleep well this night, my sacred angel, for I will guard your dreams
-Nightmask_
