ok, here's the plan:
For my first area, I will do a White Zombie concert area, 
complete with Beavis and Butt-head, and cool mobs like Astro-creep
Soulcrusher, the Grim Reaper, well you get the idea, anything
that could be considered related to White Zombie.  I will not, however
have Satan, Lucifer, or any on his incarnations in this area (IMHO, it
just can't be done, just like making a mob called Jesus or God, or Allah would
not do justice to the deity).  This area will be roughly 50-80 rooms, depending on how
creative I get.  --note to self, find out if there is a ftp port-- I have done an area like this already
on a now-defunct mud (Paradox, it used to be at paradox.vmedia.com port 10478 and later
at darkleaf.catalogue.com port 10478, but it's history as far as I can tell)

My rooms will be mass produced, and I will have one mob file that will randomly generate
several different mobs.  The seating area of the stadium (or hockey arena) will be low level (5-10)
and the stage will be high level (20-40, depending on who you fight).  Floor mobs _WILL_ be aggro,
and stage mobs will interact somewhat...most likely rudely (cursing, asking the player
what the fuck they think their doing on stage)...in order to get to stage, player must
kill one of two bouncers in order to gain access to the stage...and the exit from the concert will
be guarded by the Electric Head, an _INSANELY_ huge mob (level 70+, maybe even higher
depending on player level limits) --note to self, if bouncer is killed, have mobs be able to stage-dive--

Anyhow, I know that this will be a popular area, because it is loosely based on another
concert area (again, from the old Paradox) featuring GWAR....

And if we ever happen to get domains worked in, I have a plan for that too.....a Cartoon domain
(again, this has all been worked out in advance, I just need to code it)


Viva La Resistance, or something like that
