One of which is that this board now actually saves your notes. :DThere is now a working pub and shop in the castle.  Have fun finding them.I've added an entire section of the castle devoted to guards, guard trainees, and their families.  Have fun slaughtering them.I've added some secret passages and hidden shit to make life a little moreinteresting around here.And finally, the first floor is just about complete.  The only addition thatmight get done before I have to leave is that you might see a couple state rooms appear on the first floor.  Something like that.If you have any questions, problems, or comments on this area, feel free toreport it through the \"bug\", \"typo\", \"idea\", or \"praise\" command..
