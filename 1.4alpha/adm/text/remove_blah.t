You find yourself wandering outside of your body.  You look down and
see your dead body.  You immediately think, "This bites ass."
###
You find it hard to resist floating up... up... up.
###
You float to the top of what appears to be a mountain.  There, standing
all alone, is a man dressed in a long black cloak and robes, wielding
a glowing sickle.
###
Death says [to you]: State your business here!  Oh.. heh.  My bad, you're
dead ain't ya.
###
Death looks at some papers.  Death looks at you.
###
Death snickers at you.
###
Death says [to you]: Wanna see what it says about you here?
Death points to some papers.
###
Death takes your head in his hands and nods it for you.
###
Death holds up a paper with your name on it.
Beneath your name in HUGE letters is one word..
###
                                                ASSHOLE.
###
Death says [to you]: You're shit out of luck.
###
Death opens a hatch marked "ASSHOLE".
###
Death grabs you by the back of the neck and holds you over the hatch, laughing.
###
Death says [to you]: Have a nice trip..
###
Death says: Asshole.
###
Death drops you into oblivion.
All goes black.
