As you enter the Tavern everybody suddenly gets quiet
and begin to stare atyou!! once they figure out that you
are a mighty warrior in search of something to drink to help
take the pain's of battle away, they all begin to chant for
you and make you fell as though your part of them.  You see here a Menu.
