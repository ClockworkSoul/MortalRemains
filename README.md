# Mortal Remains MUD

Once upon a time (1997-2000), in another life, I was known as "Cyanide". I was just a kid, teaching myself to code by crafting an imaginary world known as "Mortal Remains MUD" assisted by a closely-knit pack of coding creatives with names like Chronos, Nightmask, and Spooner.

Mortal Remains was based on the TMI-2 mudlib version 1.4 alpha.

I release this code into the public domain. Enjoy!
