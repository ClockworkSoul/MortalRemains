Alucard is Mortal Remains' resident newbie helper. He is programmed to 
answer many of the questions you would have as a newbie.

The syntax to answer a question is: 

    ask alucard about thing
    
where "thing" is the subject you wish to inquire about.

Additionally, Alucard can give you newbie equipment if you are a low
enough level player. To get this equipment while in the same room as
Alucard, simply type: 

    say help
