He thinks that I am a character named Loucorn.  In actuality I am using his internet address to play this.  He has repeatedly killed me in unfair methods. For instance, Out of no where a text piece comes up saying this \" a foriegn character has canceled you character : 207 : 457: 345\" and then I loose all commands for my character.  So I have to start over and reconnect my character but by that time, I am dead from fighting Abyss or some other god like character.  This only occurs when Abyss is online and if you could stop it I would appreciate it.
