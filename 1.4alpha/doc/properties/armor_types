Valid armor types include the following:

banded
brigandine
chain
field plate
full plate
helmet
hide
leather
padded
plate
ring mail   (to differentiate it from the "ring" type)
scale
shield
splint
studded     (standard studded leather armor...)
boots
amulet
gloves
gauntlets   (Redundant, but there if you want it)
robes
ring        (Standard magical ring - you know)
cloak
bracers
girdle (Nightmask put this one in cause  he liked the idea)
belt (Nightmask again, cause DA says a belt holds up your pants.)

To set the magical value of the armor, DO NOT change the
"armor" value of the armor.  Instead, set the "magic_defense"
value, which should be equal to the number of steps in ac
improvement the item gives you.

For example, a Ring of Protection +3 would have a "magic_defense"
of 3.   Easy.   :)

If you can think of any other armors you would like added to the
function, by all means feel free to mail me.  :)
