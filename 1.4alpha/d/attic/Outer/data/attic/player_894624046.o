I have better things to do than waste my time on something where it looks more and more like an inf. admin.  take it as you will.i guess mega is the man.

Am i whining?  yep.  oh well.I deal with shit worse than that everyday ","id":267,]),(["id":268,"body":"Most mud experience levels increase exponentialy every level.Ours (because i am so anally D&D based) do not.I've noticed over time that this causes a slight problem.It becomes easier and easier to attain each experience level on thismud. This is because the player's power level increases while thekills get easier and easier. And the xp remains the same.As a D&D DM of many years, I have never given, and never will givea high level character experience for wiping out a village of innocentand (relatively) helpless farmers. Now had the player been first level,those farmers could have posed a threat to life and limb. And wouldbe worth some type of reward.I have 1 of two options at this point:1 - keep the code and my thoery (whic by the way works as follows:   You get -10% experience for every level over ten that you are over a monster to a min of 1 xp)or 2 - make it so that the experience charts continue to go up exponentiallyover tenth level.But I will say this It SHOULD be harder to attain 29th level than second.On this I am sure all the admin are in agreement.Vote how you want, 1 or 2 , I'll code either one.","time":892559777,"poster":"Ilzarion","title":"reasoning (is it sound??)",]),(["title":"Just to let y'all know.","poster":"Chronos","time":892576770,"body":"I'm going through all the lazy/sloppy code of the main town here and revampingit.

Occasionally your car would just die for no reason, you'd haveto restart it. For some strange reason, you would just accept this.4. You could only have one person at a time in your car, unless youbought a car '95 or a car NT, but then you'd have to buy more seats.5. Sun Motorsystems would make a car that was solar powered,twice as reliable, 5 times as fast, but only ran on 5% of the roads.6. The oil, alternator, gas, engine warning lights would bereplaced with a single \"General Car Fault\" warning light.7. People would get excited about the \"new\" features in Microsoftcars, forgetting completely that they had been available in otherbrands for years.9.
