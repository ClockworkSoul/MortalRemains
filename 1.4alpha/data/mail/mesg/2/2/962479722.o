If you areinterested in coding with us, just find either me or Cyanide online.We are the only ones you have to convince that you wanna code. ;)If you have any questions regarding what we expect or how the lib isset up.. or anything technical, either Cyanide or I can answer them.We both are experienced with indepth mudlib coding.. and we wrote prettymuch everything on here, lib-wise.So find either or us.. usually one of us is on at any given time.-Chronos."
