Driver Parody###
You find yourself wandering outside of your body.  You look down and
see your dead body.  You immediately think, "This bites ass."
###
You find it hard to resist floating up... up... up.
###
You float to the top of what appears to be a mountain.  There, standing
all alone, is a man dressed in a long black cloak and robes, wielding
a glowing sickle.
###
Death says [to you]: State your business here!  Oh.. heh.  My bad, you're
dead ain't ya.
###
Death looks at some papers.  Death looks at you.
###
Death says [to you]: You mortals make me sick; always dying and shit.
Death says [to you]: How fucking hard is it to stay alive????!!!
###
Death says: Bah, fuck the paper work, I am just gonna remove you.
###
Cyanide struggles to the top of the mountain, dragging his staff behind him.
###
Cyanide says: Man, this mountain gets bigger every time you die.
###
Death twitches a bit.
###
Death says [to Cyanide]: Umm... Hi, Cyanide...  what's shakin'?
###
Cyanide pulls out a small black remote control, and presses a few buttons.
Death closes and eyes and starts to snore quietly.
###
Cyanide unscrews the top of Death's skull and changes a few things inside.
###
Cyanide pulls out the remote control and presses another button.
Death springs back to life.
###
Death says [to you]: Heya Newbie! If you need anything, just say so. Don't be
     afraid to "ask" me about anything, either!"
Cyanide goes, "DOH! That's the Alucard program!"
###
Cyanide says [to you]: Look, I have some work to do on this guy. Die again 
     another time, okay?
###
Cyanide touches you with his black crystal staff, and space suddently warps
sickeningly.

You find yourself elsewhere.
