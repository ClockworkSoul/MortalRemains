The Cave.
Upon arrival at the entrance, the player is met by a strong adventurer-type. He is
large and carries two things(assuming no one else has been there): a large sword(*) and
an magical necklace. If the player asks the adventurer-type guy about the necklace, the
adventurer type informs the player that the necklace belongs to a beautiful princess
trapped inside the cave(a bit cliched, but who cares?) by an evil wizard. The adventurer
then asks the player if the player will go into the cave to get the princess, 'cause
the adventurer is too afraid. If the player is high-leveled and brave, then the player
types 'yes', at which point the adventurer gives the player the necklace. If the player
is stupid, he/she can attempt to attack the adventurer, but he is high-leveled and
dangerous(but, not as dangerous as the cave).

* The sword will have a unique version of itself that will kick butt.

Upon entering the cave, the player has to maneuver around to find the wizard. Unfor-
tuneately for the player, there are various monsters wandering around that will
kill any newbie with a look. If the player gets through the cave to the wizard, he/she
will then have to kill the wizard. Upon killing the wizard, the player gets a nice
wand, a reward from the princess, and has completed the quest.

The cave is a labrynth. It is not easy to maneuver. Also, without the necklace,
the player can not see(even with a torch or any other magic lighting). On a scale from
1-100, 1 being newbie monster, 100 is dangerous for even a wiz to attack, the wandering
monsters are about 20-30, the adventurer is 30 and the wizard is 50. The monsters,
of course, carry various useful items.
