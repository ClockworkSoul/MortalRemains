You maywant to put it in ~cattt/obj/  Its just easiest that way.Then, in your workroom, put the line:   call_other(\"/u/c/cattt/obj/myboard.c\", \"???\");Of course, substitute the name of your board for the file in theanove call_other statement. If you have any problems, let me know.I'll be happy to fix. :)-C-We have enough youth, how about a fountain of Smart."
