An overview of the ocean domain as it is today, and my plans
for it in the future. 8/4/00


  So far i have 6 main areas in mind. They are:

     1. The Beach (open) this area is for beginning players.
        Basic monsters, pretty easy kills and some credits.
        In the future, i might add a boardwalk complete with
        stores, and some people.

     2. The Sea (open) this area is for mid-level players 
        as well, although a bit tougher. There is little
        money to be gotten here, it is mainly for the xp.
        Again, pretty generic sea creatures here. The idea is
        to have this area link to the deep ocean you'll have
        to get some gear, an oxygen tank(not yet coded) and then
        you'll be able to dive. 

     3. The Deep Sea (open!) this is the underwater area.
        You'll want protection to be down there. The monsters are
        quite tough, as it is set up, it is for level 9 and over.
        The last 3 areas might branch off from here.

     4. A City (Nemar's) Not real sure about the specifics
        on this area yet, but possibly have a pub, and shops and
        whatnot. I'm thinking this will be inside an underwater dome
        or something. 

     5. Island(s) (not started) again, not sure about the specifics
        just know i want one, maybe more. (ideas appreciated)

     6. Ship Graveyard (not started) a collection of abandoned, 
        sunken ships, complete with ghosts and all that cool stuff.


  I now have a couple wizzes working on the area with me. 
  If anyone else would like to volunteer, just let me know.
  I'm happy for any help, ideas or actual coding. =)
