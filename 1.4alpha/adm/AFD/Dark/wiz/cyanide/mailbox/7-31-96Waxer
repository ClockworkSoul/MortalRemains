Subject: Shaman wielding
==================================
I have restricted shaman weapon use to items that have

               "SH_WEAP"  as their FIRST "id"

So, if y'all want to wield a weapon you must first

     call <weapon>;add;id;({ "SH_WEAP", });

I think that will work...

So, if it don't nuke yer guild ob and wield it, and then clone a
   new one.

This wielding thing took a LOT of work (as did the comapanion spell,
    so, please, please enjoy them.)

Also, I am taking ideas on what the guild object is to be,

   I changed it to spirit bag, to prevent any confusion with the
     Rangers' spirit pouch on SE.

   So, please, Let me know =).
