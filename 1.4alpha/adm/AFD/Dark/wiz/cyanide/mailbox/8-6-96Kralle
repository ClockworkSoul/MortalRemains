==================================
Hey Cyanide! Cidco told me about this place, I sent an email to
Chronos too but I heard you're on more often nowadays :) I'm
interested in being a coder, I have some experience with LPC
and I LOVE fantasy (Tolkien, Eddings etc.) and have a lot of good
ideas! :) Thanks.
