#Kyrnad focuses an energy bolt at you.
Your body convulses twitches uncontrollably.
You fall to the floor.

#You clear your head.
Kyrnad says: You must concentrate now.

#Kyrnad begins to teach you basic techniques, blocking, punching, parrying. 

#Kyrnad says: If nothing within you stays rigid, outward things will disclose themselves.  Moving, be like water. Still, be like a mirror. Respond like an echo.

#You begin to learn at an excellerated rate. Your feel yourself getting faster.
