#Kyrnad spins around and delivers a backkick to your stomach, knocking you to the floor.
Kyrnad shakes his head.

#Kyrnad says: Have you learned nothing?

#Kyrnad teaches you intermediate techniques, kicking, sweaping. 

#Kyrnad says: Wisdom does not consist of trying to wrest the good from the evil
but in learning to "ride" them as a cork adapts itself to the crests and troughs of the waves.

#You focus your mind on the moment. You become more fluid.
