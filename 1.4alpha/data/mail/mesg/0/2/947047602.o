mesg "hey man, read the main board, i thought of a sweet sig spellchceGimme the power to turn a whiz into a normal player for a periodof time.  IE they cant teleport arount, cant zap me, cant patch meand adjust my max hps, cant use special weapons like a black crystalstaff *cough*.  they will just be a player, a level 1 player, untilleither i kill them, or i quit (or link die).  scratch that, untillSOMEONE kills them, a player not a mob.  Lessee what else, oh yeahI'll be willing to accept a limitation such as only being able to use this power on a particular whizzard once per reboot.  Or, if the muddoesnt reboot at least once a day then lets say once per 24 hr period.you will have to do something to make sure a whiz doesnt artificiallypatch thier stats up just to provike me and wipe the floor with me, thats why i say just drop em down to level 1 so they dont reallyhave any defence.  Cause if u think about it, if a whiz is pissingme off, odds are they are doing things to me i dont have any defenceagainst.  Also, u gotta make sure they cant edit files or quitwhile in this state, including posting to boards (cause on a lot of mudsthat makes u immune to pk) and if they link die they do NOT turn into a statue, they are fair game.hrm, what else ... i cant think of anything else right now.So whaddya think, is that one doable?-hoss (please say yes Please say yes PLEASE say yes)Oh and for the record, id NEVER use it on you if u dont watn me tohey, quit trying to look behind my back, my hands are justresting back there, nothign to see, nothing to see at all."
