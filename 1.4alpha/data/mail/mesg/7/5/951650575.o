mesg "Hi hon;last night hoss connected as chupacabra because something weird was hapenning with his char. The fact is that he was behaving as if he had PMS. I loged in as always, and I found him and cataclysm in something that seemed like an argue. I said if there was a problem, perhaps I could fix it. And he started to insult me and I got like ' hold on, who are you and what harm have I done to you?' I'm sorry I didn't log this on the harassment 10 you taught me. But I thought I could handle it. He says I harassed him lotsa times, and when I asked what was it, he said about my hitler monster. When I first made it, I let him test it. I was a new wizard then, and I didn't know he was a player. Then I saw he was, and decided to zap the monster before he could finish it. He's been mad about me since then. And he says he forgave me then because I was a new wiz. But he haven't forgive me because he insulted me freely last night. I would be glad if the three of us get a meeting to clear things out. You, me, and hoss.ThanksATTLady Nsd"
