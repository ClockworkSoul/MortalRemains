Evil Geniuses In A Nutshell, Appendix A: "Poetry For The Web"

    Our yellow sun yields to the dark
    As I begin my web-based lark.
    flowing, turning, through the pipe
    I grep for text and dump the hype...

    But as I ride the fibre trail
    I test my faith as I read my mail.
    Even as mt bandwitth fattens
    I question life and 1-click patents...

    Although I ask and though I query
    I know the truth, I grok the theory.
    Life is a multimedia of sins
    so he who collects the most porn wins.
