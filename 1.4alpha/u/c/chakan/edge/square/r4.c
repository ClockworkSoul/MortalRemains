The great hourglass-shaped tower overshadows this portion of the 
town square. The streets appear to be well-kept here, made of brick 
laid down to create a solid walkway for travelers.  Directly south is 
one of the supporting towers for the main structure, surrounded by a 
flower garden on the ground level.  To the east and west are skywalks 
reaching from the main tower to other buildings on the outside of the 
town square.
