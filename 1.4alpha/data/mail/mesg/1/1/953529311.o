mesg "hey cy, ive bene reminded of a problem with the proficiency system herethat i think u need to fix.  When newbies log on, more oftenthan not they dont have a clue what to chews for WP and NWP slots, because, wellbecause they dont knwo the mud, i mean how are they to know there are no staffson to use, some poeple think just because they are mages they have to shoose staffs.but anyway, i think u should do something to help us all out who have madebad decisions.  Make a room or something where we can reclaim prof slots for a costit could be either xp or coins, i think most of us would be williung to pay almost anyprice for it.  Mebbe make it so we like 'reclaim ambidexterity' and it takes 1 off ofcbour ambidexterity skilla nd gives us a wp (or nwp whatever we used to get it) slot back that we can use.-hoss"
