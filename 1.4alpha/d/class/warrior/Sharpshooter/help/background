The Sharpshooters were initially founded in the year 2032.
It was a time when the world called out for a warrior of
legend that could handle the weaponry of today.  Valor of 
Olde times and the Technology of Modern Day intertwined
to produce Irol Ecierif, the Legendary Gunslinger, and Master
of Fire Arms.  Irol heeded the world's call for a Hero and
showed the world that a wielder of the firearms of the Modern
Age could perform as valiantly in battle as any Warrior.
The world learned, and many sought to follow Irol's path.
And so the elite society known as the Sharpshooters came about.
Go forth into the world and make a name for yourself, Gunslinger!
