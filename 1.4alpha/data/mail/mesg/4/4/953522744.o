mesg "dude, i thought u were going to fix these buggers so they couldnt attack thier mastersanymore.  i just got killed by my own pet .... again.  what happened was, i had a pit fiend and a warrior, i was tryign to make the pitprotect the warrior, and i was fighitng a highly-trained warrior.  my warrior diedright b4 i hit enter, so nearest i can figure, the pit protected the guy i was trying tokill and he attacked me.  But i thought u said u were going to preventpets from attacking thier owners.  WTFi do not appear to have lost anything, and i survived, so i guess its cool ...well besides the fact that i lost my autoloads .... i got em all back excepttalisman, so hook me up when u get back-hossWTF"
