Some say that no news is good news.  Well not this time.. The class is 
being completely revamped.  All powers are being reviewed, and in all 
likelihood, going to be increased.  I think it's safe to say that the breech
command won't be changing again any time soon, unless any major 
problems develop with it.

Also, the headshot ability has been completely revamped.  See the help
file on it for the latest details.

One of the ideas currently being tossed around is to increase the critical 
hit chance percentages for the Sharpshooters.  If anyone has any ideas 
for more powers, emotes, or ANYTHING pertaining to this class, send
all ideas to Chronos.
