mesg "heya-well, I made a drown.h file, and included it in my first underwater room.and it worked, with no errors! yay :)The only problem i see, is that if you enter the room with the brooch,then get rid of it, ie dest it, you don't start taking damage. I'm notsure how to go about changing that. But anyway, check out drown.h inand thanks again for all the help :)Yvan"
