Arcanology   (Wizard, Priest skill)

The thaumaturgy allows the caster a greater selection of spells
whenever he or she advances in level. Whereas normally a mage
would be allowed 4 spells of any given spell level (as an
example), the thaumaturgy skill would allow one more selection
of each spell level.
