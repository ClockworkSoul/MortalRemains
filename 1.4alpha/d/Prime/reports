if your looking for good offensive spells, hjeres one
drainign touch.  when you cast it, you cant use 
any other weapons, but every time you touch your opponent
you drain power from them kinda like a vampire, it heals you
up.  This would be a good one if you decide to bring back a
guild like monks or something that likes fighting bare handed
and using spells.

this is more of a question.  and im not sure if its still true,
but im willing to bet it is, and ive always meant to ask about
it.  Why do you need a target to cast an area attack?  it doesn't
matter who u cast it at yer gunna hit everyone in the room,
so why require a target?  There were times when i knew a thief
was hidden in a room but i couldnt hit him with a fireball
unless someone else walked in and i casted the fireball at

you should have some kevlar as armour on here.
ca
kevlar vests would be the obvious thing, and they
rock, but since a mage cant use them dont stop there
there are also kevlar entry vests which are designed
to be worn over yer normal vest and all yer clothes and 
thats what cops wear when they're going on raids.  Awesome
protection.  Those would fall more into a cloak category
though.  BTW, if youve never worn a bullet proof vest b4, 
lemme tell you, u feel like fuckin superman in it.  And
its even better with an entry vest over the top.  I let
ce

people whale away on me with one on and i never felt a thing,
and u dont lose any mobility with them either, other than
the fact that they are so dam heavy.  obviously the
disadvantage si they only cover yer chest, thats why you
could make some kevlar gloves, boots (i know those dont really
cb
exist but this is make beleive anyway) and also we need some
bullet-proof helmets, they actually make these, riot helmets,
there not REALLY bullet proof, but they are bullet resistant,
as long as the bullet doesnt hit straight on, the helmets will
deflect them.  

Anyway, just an idea, in case u ever read these logs.

Oh yeah, i was also thinking that if u had a kevlar
vest on, it would give u protection from prokectiles,
like u only take 1/2 damage, and the damage would be bludgening
instead of whatever kind of damage bullets do.  2 limitations
of kevlar vests along this vein, .22 rimfires are notorious
for being able to penetrate vests (even vests rated to
stop .44 mags at point blank range).  This has to do
with thier small diameter and low velocity, they just
bore right through the fibers.  Also, kevlar vests
do not even slow down edged weapons like knives.  Well
i guess they do slow down slashes, but not stabs.  Again
cs
the whole small diameter/low velocity thing i think.  
Not real sure on the physics there.  

1more thing, bullet proof vests also all have a shock
plate that is removeable.  Maybe you could code a
lil quest where we could find a shock plate for our
vest.  Normally these shock plates will lessen
the bludgenoning damage the wearer feels (usually
when ya get shot in the vest, the bullet wont touch you
but the force of the bullet can knock the wind out of ya
and break ribs etc...)  The shock plates are also able
to withstand rifleshots, most primary vests cannot do
this without a shock plate in.  However, most entry
vests are designed to protect from rifles.  Usually
when a vest is rated to protect from a rifle, like say
a .308 (a common sniper round) they mean from 100 or 200
yds away, now at point blank range.

ok that concludes tonights lesson on bullet proof vests.
i sure hope u read these things

alucard knows about sex, but not women.
I explained to nsd that the reason for this (cause she pointed it out to me)
ce
was that alucard was modeled after Nightmask.  Which meant, his 
'fair share' of sex came mostly from camels ... and some of it came from
getting pounded by other men.

anyway, i think u should change his asks to reflectr this.  if he has
ch
to knwo about women then mebbe he should just say 'fuck em and chuck em, thats what
I say'

heh

oh and when u ask hiom about camels, sheep, chickens, or bestiality, perhaps he should

alucard shouls tell a joke, say when u ask him about jokes.

heres 1 for him.

One day Nightmask and Deviant were walking through a field when they
came across a little sheep with its head caught in a barbed wire fence.

The sheep was just struggling trying to get out .. going 'maaAAAA, MAAAAAAAA'

Nightmask said, 'Hey deviant, we should help that little guy.'  But diviant
said wait, not just yet, lets have some fun.'  So deviant pulls down his pants
and starts screwing the snot out of the lamb.  The whole time the lambs just sitting
there going 'maaAAaaaa, MAAAAAA' (thats sposed to be a sheep sound in case u dont
recognize it, hes not calling for his momma).  Anyway, when deviant gets through,
he looks over at Nightmask and says, 'So, u want a piece of this before we
free him?'  

Nightmask goes, 'Sure!' and he gets down on all 4's, sticks his head in the
fence and starts going 'maaAAAA, MAAAAA'

I loged off and then back on and the cop bots are still hunting me. i didnt want
to fight them and I dont think that this is right. 
Is this the way that things are supposed to happen? Even if a player logs off
the monsters or what ever still hunt you? Or are Cop Bots just auto attack

but anyway, i can get to the sanctuary with the ancient gold ring even from

Personally, i think u should just leave this, soince there are only 3 charges
in the ring and its not really all that east to get, and in fact im pretty sure
im the only one who even knows where it is, and i dont tell people where
the secret stuff is.  But, i had to report it to keep my conciense clear.

	My idea is that we get some kind of 'Spell' and i use the term loosely
that allows us to have greater accuracy when using a weapon befitting
our guild. ie: when I wield a 'gun' I can cast an accuracy spell that gives me
bonuses to hit and to dammage for the durration of the 'spell'. 

Just my 2 cents,

Soulcrusher

Players and wizzes shouldn't be allowed to dammage/take dammage from each other
this is, in my opinion, a rather large bug.  I was testing it out last night
and I actualy was hurting and almost killing a wizard, who at this time will
remain nameless, as the point here is just to identify a problem not incriminate
others.

if you set up an alias to kill the dealer by running in and out, and use it a few times then when you walk into the room, you willl start beating the crap out of him and he won't fight back. its a one sided fight... a bit easy to kill him that way.
