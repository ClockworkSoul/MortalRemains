Heart of Stone (Level VIII Wizard Spell - Alteration, Necromancy)

Cost: 100 Spell Points				Area of Effect: Caster
Duration: 20 sec/lvl

	This potent spell exchanges the necromancer’s own living 
heart for a finely crafted heart of perfect, unblemished stone 
that alters the very nature of the wizard’s body. As long as the
heart of stone remains in effect, the caster need not fear attacks
that pierce, slash, or cut him; he does not bleed and can ignore
the most horrible injuries of this kind. The disadvantage to all this
is that most forms of healing are ineffective on the caster.
