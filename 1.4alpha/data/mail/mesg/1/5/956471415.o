mesg "Couple questions about the Apache Web server.First, that is what Prowlers runs right?Second, Apache supports Jave applets and scripts right?Third, VBscript?Fourth, what about ASP pages?I found a way to get around the problems I was having before withthe errors I was getting when I used FrontPage to make the site, soright now it is full steam ahead again.Just trying to figure out what I can and cannot do on Apache,Thanks for any input you give.Raven"
