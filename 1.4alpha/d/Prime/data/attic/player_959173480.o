Because what winds up happening isa newbie will log in, make friends with a high lvl, and get ungodly amounts ofxp without ever actually having to work for it.  Thats just not right.  And I'll admitthat i do the same thing for friends who log onto other muds that have banding, butit don't make it right, and I don't plan to do it here.  -hoss (already appears to be outvoted)","id":140,]),(["title":"banding","poster":"Raven","time":955208883,"body":"in response to Hoss's note about banding being a cheap way for newbiesto skyrocket up in levels I propose a new theory on the subject.  Wellnot all that new, more a just a combo of all the ones I have used.First, players would have to be within a certain range of each other, sayfive levels, in order to be able to band.  This would be dropped after say level25 so that after that anyone above 25 could band.  Second the exp sharingwould have to be shared in a percentage based on level (pretty standard)and third (this is the kicker) limit it so that nobody under level 5 canband at all.  Other ideas, implement a list of people that you have killed and a list ofpeople that have killed you.  Anybody on these lists will not be able to bandwith you EVER.  That way if some player runs around on a rampage killing everyone, later on that player will not be able to be helped by those thathe has previously killed.  And all references to he in this note should havebeen read as he/she.Raven the Politically Correct  (atleast today)","id":141,]),(["title":"26","poster":"Bomber","time":955217150,"body":"In response to Hoss' and Raven's note...	I think that we would all agree that according to the ideas that Ravenhas suggested as criterion for banding is pretty good.  The fact that you have to be within a certain level of eachother is Key. I also like the idea of not bandingwith people you have killed etc... That just make sense.I guess I vote that with the right rules it would work great!Bomber","id":142,]),(["id":143,"body":"whats wrong with banding with people you've played pk with?  I mean u got a lostlist rather, in case you forget, and if you've forgiven, whats the big deal.  Me anbomber might get bored one day and decide to pk each other, thats no reason for us tonot be able to band later.If you do banding, just make sure that everyone who gets xp is actually killing, infact, make it so that if you have some that are idling, or just not pulling thier weight, they lose xp.-hoss","time":955314043,"poster":"Hoss","title":"banding",]),(["id":144,"body":"A list of people you have killed and VV is already availble:type 'kills'I'm considering several methos of making banding fair.
