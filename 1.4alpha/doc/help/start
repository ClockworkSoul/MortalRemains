              - Welcome to Mortal Remains! -

Mortal Remains is a MUD based upon a standard AD&D style world,
only several hundred years after the typical time period in 
which most MUDs take place. Here, technology has advanced to 
the point where it is roughly equal in power to magic, at a 
point slightly more advanced than our present day Earth.

Character stats are very similar to those in a standard AD&D
world, typically ranging from 3 to 18 (though there are a few
exceptions for non-human races). 

If there are any other questions not covered by the various
help files, please feel free to mail Cyanide or Chronos from
the MUD post office.
