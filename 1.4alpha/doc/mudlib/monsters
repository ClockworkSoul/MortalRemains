Easiest functions to use when making monsters wield weapons and wear armor:

arm(string filename, string object_id) ;

wear(string filename, string object_id) ;

These functions will clone objects, move them to the monster object and
make the monster wield it or wear it.  It uses the standard mudlib wear and
equip functions, so there's no need to worry about making monsters equip 
things that would be impossible for player.s

NOTE:  Since this was originally written, there has been an
update to these fuctions in the mudlib.
      You no longer need to use those arguments with these functions,
      but they are still supported.  You no longer need to include an
      id for the object, and the first argument can be an object.
