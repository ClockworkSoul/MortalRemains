==================================
Hiya, i was looking into listing our site on some mud type lists and stuff,
and talking to a couple of other wizzes and we decided to maybe wait til the
website was a bite more done. then we decided that we should help you with that
ultra large task, so here are some thoughts we had. if you have any questions
or want any clarifications please feel free to ask. also, we're willing to help
in any way we can, so let us know if you need some. =) my notes follow.

Brainstorming on the Mortal Remains Website.
Valkyrie, Sophia and Shya, ideas and notes :

background - not just white?

lore - speak to NM about background of the mud, i've heard he knows a good
bunch of 'story' like stuff about these things..

-include current character info, maybe short bios submitted by players?
perhaps match them with the pics.. seperated into a players page and an
wizards page.. players - name, class, bio..

-a FAQ page or a page with the current postings on the players board to
keep people updated

-a newbie map/info thing like the "welcome to decatur" leaflet

-should include info about how deaths are different on our mud than most
common muds - the possibility of being purged, not losing levels etc..

-a page describing classes and the character requirements to get in them
and some info about them

That's it, hope we've helped. if you want me to bug people about stuff or 
something, let me know, i'm good at poking people till they do things =)

Hope all is well by you,
V
