The smallest and weakest race of goblinkind is the race of kobolds. A 
kobold stands about three feet in height, with a scaly hide of dark brown
to rusty black, and glowing red eyes in a vaguely dog-like face. Due to 
their lack of physical prowess, kobolds specialize in dirty tricks, 
distractions, and traps.

His inferior size gives a kobold a -1 to Strength and Constitution.
