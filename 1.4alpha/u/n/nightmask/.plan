A frog walks into a bank and sits down to get a loan. He notices that
his loan officers name is Patrica Wack. He says to her, "Hello Mrs.
Wak, My name is Kermit Jagger, my father is Mic Jagger, I would like
a loan so I can go on a long vacation." She looks at him and says well
How much would your like, 30,000 is the response. "that's a lot of
money, do you have colateral?" "I have this, and it should be enough
because I know the Bank Manager." With that he produces a purple and
pink elephant, and hands it to her. She stands and goes to talk to the
Bank Manager, "Sir, there's a frog out here that says he knows you,
he gave me this as colateral, can you tell me what this is?"
"It's a nick-nack Patty Wack, give the frog a loan, his old man's
a Rolling Stone."
