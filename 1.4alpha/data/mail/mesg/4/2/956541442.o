Seems like a wonder to me. And I've been arriving late at home, so I haven't been able to get my ass into mortal remains or nightfalls-keep. And yes, I'm recruiting people for both muds. Look, All I want is to make'em both rock. Whatever happenned between you admins is between you, none of my business. So please, don't fight for me, it will make me sad. And you know I have now limits of time imposed by my husband. :*(  I knew this would bring some conflict. I see admins are      possessive with their wizards. I can understand that. That's why I asked you the other day if you were mad at me for coding an extra mud. I never meant to make you sad. All I know from coding is thanks to you, and I said that to Nightmask. So I owe you a lot. See ya monday perhaps.> Lady Nsd> I have no quarrel with NM...   it;s the other \"admin\"...-C-Sleep: A completely inadequate substitute for caffeine."
