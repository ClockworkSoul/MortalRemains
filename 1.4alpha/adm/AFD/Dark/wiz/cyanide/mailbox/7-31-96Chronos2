==================================
Oh yeah.  Corpses can be queried for "level", which will be the level
of the creature that was killed.  When you are animating corpses, 
here's a few things to keep in mind.  Er.. things I'd like to see you
implement.

- They should be slightly lower level than their living counterparts.
  You know, death stat/level loss.

- They should not be capable of any complex tasks.  Killing and maiming
  is fine, but I'm not sure about being able to follow orders.  Perhaps
  they could carry things that were given to them, and would drop them
  when they died.  

- They need to have a time limit/spell duration, prob based on guild level.
