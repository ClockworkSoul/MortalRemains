mesg "i dunno if you remember, but when i was smaller the mud once forgotto save my level when i logged out.  The net effect was just thatcei got an extra hp advance, so no big deal.  Well, it happened again.Same effect so still no big deal.  But, next time i level im going totry to recreate it.  Just so you know, im thinking it might have something to do with me not learning a new spell right away.  So far i'veonly done that twice, where i hold off on choosing until the next time,and both times the mud forgot my lvl.  -ill keep ya posted-hoss"
