Kyako sword up and down several times he would be a saint. That's all good and well. However: \"Not doingit ever again\" is not the issue here. After all, all wizards lostthe priveledge to \"eval\" due to the abuses of what boils down toone wizard. He has no respect for us or our decisions. I get mail DAILY askingme why one person got promoted or why I made some change. What itcomes down to is a LACK OF RESPECT.That ends now. -C"
