mesg "Lesson #2:How to describe the items in your room:The following is an example of a room description:Skeleton BarThis is what remains of what once was a bar. Peasants call itSkeleton Bar because of the many corpses around. There's aneglected table to the left, and some chattered glasses.            The only obvious exit is south*Notice that there are some key words that can keep the attention  of the player. Here, a player can get attracted by the words:*corpses*table*glassesthose are the words you gonna use for the function *item_desc.This is what \"item_desc\" does:when the player types \"look corpses\", \"exa corpses\", \"l corpses\", \"examine corpses\"...(any of those phrases will display the next message) a descriptionlike this is gonna appear:Maggot ridden corpses. All you see is dust and bones. Some of them have flesh still. EWWW...* To make that, you'll edit your room like I taught youin the room code, find this line:    set( \"item_desc\",  ([*Once you get that, you'll put your item descriptions as follows: set( \"item_desc\",  ([\"corpses\" : \"Maggot ridden corpses. All you see is dust and bones.\\n\"+\"Some of them have flesh still. EWWW...\\n\",\"table\" : \"A wooden table. It's full of dust and scratches.\\n\",\"glasses\" : \"Shattered glasses. Not a single one is complete and whole.\\n\",]) ); }* Notice that every line ends with this: \\n\" <---this is VERY important.If the line is not finished, you end the \\n\"  with a (+)  like this  \\n\"+If the line is finished, you end it like this: \\n\",*important not to forget that each line must NOT have more than 70 characters.Now look at the \"table\" : \"....  line.  The words \"dust\" and \"scratches\"keep the attention of the player. You may need to add descriptions forthose words too.*Add them like the examples above, so it would look like this:set( \"item_desc\",  ([\"corpses\" : \"Maggot ridden corpses. All you see is dust and bones.\\n\"+\"Some of them have flesh still. EWWW...\\n\",\"table\" : \"A wooden table. It's full of dust and scratches.\\n\",\"glasses\" : \"Shattered glasses. Not a single one is complete and whole.\\n\",\"dust\" : \"Just dust. DOH!!!\\n\",\"scratches\" : \"Deep scratches made by human fingernails. You suspect they belong\\n\"+\"to the corpses.\\n\",]) );}*notice that the descriptions can be whatever you like. ALWAYS ALWAYS ALWAYSmake a research of what words will catch the eye of the player, and describethem.This has been introduction to wizardhood lesson #2Lady Nsd"
