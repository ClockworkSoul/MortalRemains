ATTENTION:
  The mud webserver should not be used.

  The web site for Mortal Remains will be hosted directly
  on the prowlers server at prowlers.com/~mortal_remains

  This also means that wizards et al should not have a 
  public_html dir in their home base directory because
  those sites would be on the mud webserver.  This may change
  in the future but for now please remove all public_html
  directories.
