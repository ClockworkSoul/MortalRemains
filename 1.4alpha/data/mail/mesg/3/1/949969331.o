mesg "dark bloomsI lie down in nothing but air.The garden is in this room growing. It isgrowing the was a cactus grows whose spinesare no explanation for paradise. Somewherein the heart of all of it there is a flower waiting,its dark bloon a thunder. O but the air.It holds me in the measure of what distance is,a place as clean as morning. She is coming with her songs.And I am waiting for her, waiting for herto begin, my nakedness like the cactuswho dreams among its spines of flowersobviously not written from a female perspective but still i like it..cat"
