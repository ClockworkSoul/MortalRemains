==================================
I don't think I ever responded to your question about damage types
from your mail re: your guild from WAAAY back..

receive_damage(int damage, string type)

DOes that answer your question? :)


But when you are giving damage from a spell, if you call receive_damage
from the spell Object, it will never give any xp to the player for the 
kills they get with spells...  there is a spell_damage() function in 
the player object to handle that.  Check out one of my guild's combat
spells for more info on how to use those functions.

Remember that if "pk" is set to 1 in a user, he's registered for player
killing, and that both the attacker and victim have to be registered. ;)

Blahblahblahblah
