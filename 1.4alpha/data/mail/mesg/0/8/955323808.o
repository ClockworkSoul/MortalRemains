mesg "Ok cy, my sig spell needs to more powerful.  You already knew i thought that, wellheres my reasons again.  U claim to not remember this, but i went through this allonce before, the day i decided to go ahead with this spell, and u agreed with myreasoning.  First of all, the original spell i asked for was one that would average doing1k damage, this one only averages 500 dmg.  To average 1k damage ud need to eitherlike do random (2000) or random (1000)+500 or something like that.Also, the original spell was going to alternate the type of damage it did, butthats not too big a deal really.cbOk, then i decided against that spell because i realized how much damage a fighter cando.  I mean a mage is supposed to be MACK at high levels, Mages on this game arenot mack.  Look at the steel and abyss, the only two serious fighters on the game, andthey are leaving me and bomber in the dust.  The way i fugure it, a fihgtr can do upto 500 hps of damage in a round if they have good weapons, and lets face it, a fighterat my level is going to have good weapons.  With my weapons i can do like 100 in a goodround.  I also figured that you would have at least a 10 round recover time on it.  Now, the spell i have doesnt appear to have that long of a recover time, but that couldbe upped.  So anyway, in the time that i could cast 1 spell a fighter could do 5kof damage, and i could do another 1k of damage while waiting.  So, if u up thespell to 5k damage max, it would make me a little more equal with a fighterpowerwise.  Plus, i think a high level fighter has a better than average chance of doing 500 damage, and with this spell, i'll prolly only be doing like 3k max onany kind of a regular basis.  And dont bring pets into this, because they are uselessin PK, all a fighter has to do is run and make me chase him and the pets are allbut out of the equation.  So, in conclusion, raise the damage my spell does dude, mages are WAY too weak onthis dam game.  Oh and one other thing, about the spells in general, mages aresupposed to do more damage with spells than weapons, thats not true here, we run outof sps too fast and have to wait too long for recovery times for it to be true.-thanks, and get back to me to at least let me know youre going to raise the damage,even if u have to put it on the back burner for a while.  -hoss"
