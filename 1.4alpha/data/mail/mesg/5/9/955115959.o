mesg "I'm afraid I'm not quite myself today;I won't be on as much as I used to from now on. I'll explain you why;Last night my real life husband presented to me the most feared papers of allmarriages; The divorce ones. He said his last words about it and they werelike this:   \"you chose, the mud or me. Mud once more, and you lose me forever...\"Right now I'm hiding from him in order to make you know what's happenning. If hesees me doing this, I'll lose him. *sigh*  It means I have to leave Nightfalls too. Look, this mudding thing is an addiction that I don't wanna leave. I'll try from time to time to hide from my husband in order to code pieces of area here and there. I want to tell you something else; Thanks for teaching me the art of code step by step, I really appreciate it. I can't be on as much as I used to, unless I can convince my husband of the contrary. My castle is crumbling to dust... And the worst of all is that I saw it coming, but didn't care enough.Perhaps I can finish the sauna area, but will take a lotlonger, for now I have to hide from my husband.Hope I can get in touch soon.Lady Nsd"
