mesg "Grull writes:> The problem with your current arm() and wear() commands is that they rely on knowing ahead of time a string that matches a member of the 'id' array, before the object is cloned. If you'll notice, the object I'm equipping (/u/g/grull/generic/armour/generic_armour.c) could be one of 7 differet armour types, determined randomly as part of the create function. The same is true for the weapon. On a more general note, it would be nice to know how to do this sort of thing, say, if I were to code a monster that were to steal an item from a player and wear it during battle.> I took a look at monster.c, and tried to issue the same command (mon->command(\"wield <weapon name> SILENT\"), but for some reason this has no effect when I try to call it. Could you take a quick look and tell me why this approach isn't working?> >   Thanks,>   -Caleb> I'm already in the process of fixing this.  Way aheadh of ya, bud.  ;)-C------BEGIN GEEK CODE BLOCK-----Version 3.12GCS/S/SS d- s+: a-- C++(++++)>$ UL++>++++ P L++>++++ !E W++++ N+(*) o K? w+++(---) O- M V- PS+ PE Y+ PGP+ t++ 5X++ R+ tv+ b+++ DI++ D++(--) G+ e+>+++(*) h-- r++ y++*------END GEEK CODE BLOCK------"
