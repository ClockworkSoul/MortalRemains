mesg "ummm, ok, i DID have a paper to write and all...anyway, rapier comes from thief in maze, if you do it from the machine roomthe thief starts in what the room you are teleported into...the machinesettings are OFF-A-3  Good luck getting out if you don't have teleport though,since in the good ol maze e, w doesn't put u where u started...*shrug* as Isaid toget out of maze find the mirror room and \"touch mirror\" then wander out of his area.  Also, alarm and glitter hope if you can't see the thiefi, however, would suggest mapping it, since there IS another end to the mazethat will someday have cool things in it (none of it is coded yet, howevercuz no one ever made it there)-Ts"
