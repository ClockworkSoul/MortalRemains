Smite:  (Priest Command)

This ability allows a priest to invoke the wrath of his or her
deity upon an enemy. It's exact effects are subject to the whims
of the priest's deity, but can range anywhere from no effect at
all to instant and immediate death.

It is affected by the level of the priest and the alignments of
both the priest and the target.

Note that the use of this skill requires the "smite" proficiency.
