mesg "I am speaking to kyako on the phone as I write this mailHe wanted me to tell you he promises to leave your securityand your persons alone except when he cant solve a coding problemhe says that he has enough coding experience now that problems willbe reduced to a minimum.  In exchange for reinstatement he will try his hardest possible to give you time for coding this mud and will not bother you for any reasons (security, coding, etc) unless itis an emergency.  -Typed by Rehnbi for kyakoI would like him to be put back because he has helped me with coding bugsin the past and saved you valuble time. He implied that he wont waste anyof your time unneccicarryily in the future and the 49 hours he has ammasedis his maximum and he will not exceed it.  -Thanx-Rehnbi (The Player)/"
