###
In a flash you look down and see your body. You think to yourself, "this
is it.  I'm done."
###
You suddenly find yourself in a large courtroom. Cyanide is on the bench.
###
The jurors are the monsters you have ever killed.
###
Cyanide shouts: This court will come to order! Ww will now hear the case 
of Mortal Remains v. The Mortal.
###
Cyanide says [to you]: What do you have to show for your life?
###
You have nothing.
###
Cyanide says [to you]: What have you done?
###
Still nothing.
###
Cyanide looks at some papers.  Cyanide looks at you.
###
Cyanide chuckles at you.
###
Cyanide shouts: Has the jury reached a verdict?
###
Alucard stands up.
###
Alucard says [to Cyanide]: We, the population of Mortal Remains find the 
defendant guilty of the charge of mediocrity.
###
Alucard sits down.
###
Cyanide says [to you]: Seems like you done it now, kid.
###
A trap door beneath your feet opens up, and you are falling...
###
Falling...
###
Falling...
###
You never stop.
