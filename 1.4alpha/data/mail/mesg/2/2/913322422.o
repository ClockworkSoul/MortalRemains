mesg "ok, seeing as there are a multitiude of mack(and ultramack) attack spells for higher levels,i was for thinking a nifty defensive spell would bein order, specificually what i find to be very annoyingis getting blasted by spells i possess (since i know abouthow much damage they do...and it's a lot)--read archlich.so it would be logical to havea high level defensive spell...Something like Marcus' Baneful Deflector which protects vs.most magics (say lvl 1-6) automatically, and has a chance to protect vs 7-9, anda slim chance of working on lvl 10 spells.  give it a durationcomparable to globe of invulnerability, but with a much highersp cost (say 300-500)  A nifty feature would be that if it protects you,it has a chance to reflect the spell back at the bad guy (kindalike fireshield does to physical damage)  dunno if thatis feasible in the first place but it might make the spell a tadtoo powerful...just an ideaanyway, altering spells levels it's effective against andjust how effective it is alters the spell power, but i wasthinking of a 10th level enchantment (to balance out wyrmfuryand tellblow, which are both offensive terrors).-Marcus"
