mesg "Cattt,I would LOVE to go to the party.HOWEVER, as I am currently residing in Virginia,I don't think it's a possibility.Somehow I don't think I'm going to be ableto convince my fiancee to go up there.I may still be able to tho.  We'll see.Even if I were to be able to convince her togo up, since she works for TWA, we haveto fly standby.....We'll see what happens.Tyran."
