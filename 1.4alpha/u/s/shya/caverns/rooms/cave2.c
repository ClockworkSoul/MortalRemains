You are still in the entrance of a cave. 
The cave continues to the east further into the darkness.  
This seems like a good enough place to hide, 
except for the wierd sounds coming from further inside. 
Is that a dragon??? A hole has been hacked
through the tangled mass of roots allowing you to proceed east.
