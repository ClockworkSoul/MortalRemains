==================================
Ok .. suggestion time .. :)

Did you know monsters fighting skills suck ...
Let alone defensive ones .. 

I'm not sure if the following will solve the problem but it may
and if it does... good :) .. and if it doesn't, well, that wasn't
the problem then.

the problem is lines 1244 and 1246 in monster.c
They are currently out of place in the scheme of things.
Your setting the defense and attack skills before you set the dexterity
of the monster.

if you.....

ed monster.c

Saving monster.c

This will move the set_skill portion to after you set the stats for the mob.

This should allow monsters to fight back more offensively.

Just a suggestion ..
