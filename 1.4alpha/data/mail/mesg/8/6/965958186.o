mesg "Ok, how about the double ignore thing, but make sure the other person appearson my ignore list (assuming theres someone out there who wants to ignor me that is).But make it so that only the original ignorer can cancel the ignoring.There would be no additional harassment, becuase i wouldnt be able to talk toem, wouldnt see they were on, and wouldnt be able to mail em or do any emoteseither.  Make sure is i try to mail em, i get a message along the lines of (thatperson thinks your an asshole and doesnt want to hear from you).  Same thing withemotes and tells.  And, same thing with the person who did the ignoring, Like i said,I had someone who was ignoring me, but still talking to me, telling me shit, anddoing emotes to me, but i couldnt reply to em.  Also, make sure u blobk out boardmessages and especially whizzard abilities like echo and whatever else yall can useto screw with other people.  There are 2 things i still dont like about the above scheme, 1.  I don't like not having control over who i am ignoring (actually, why is it we have to do a double ignoreagain?)  and 2 i dont like the fact that some pussy could hide from me pking him byignoring me.  I mean, is this a pk mud or isnt it?  Ok, alternate plan:There is no invisibility associated with ignoring.  If someone ignores me theycant see anything i say, gossip or shout.  I cant mail, tell or emote the person without getting an ugly message telling me they think im an asshole etc...But, when i see them i see something telling me they're ignoring me.  Like thiertitle changes for me or something.  But if it is someone i want to kill, or if iwant to kill em for ignoring me, we are fighting even because they can still see me.Oh yeah, and of course they cannot use any emotes or tells or mail for me, but i canstill see what they say if im in the room, and see shouts and gossips and board messages n all that jazz.  I think thats the fairest, that way they dont have to listen to me, i don't have to ignore them just because they are being babies, andPK is not compromised at all.-lata-hoss"
