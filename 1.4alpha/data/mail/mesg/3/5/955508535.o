mesg "Hey, i thought of a great idea for what to do with money.  Allow us to buy slots, both WP and NWP.  like u could goto the skills rooms, andif u dont have slots, instead of selecting a number, u 'bribe x' and u just bribesomeone for like Rnd(200000) credits per slot or something.  Also, u could make thepossibility of allowing people to go over thier classes max for certain weaponskills by +1.  Not sure if its set up to handle fighters with +6 though.  But thatshould also count for say ... mages and rifles, so i could get a 1 in long arms.Anyway, thats a heck of an idea for cash, whaddya think.Oh yeah another one, allow us to raise stats, the only ones i care about arestr,con,dex.  If wis and int are any good, throw those in too, but i doubt they are.-lata-hoss"
