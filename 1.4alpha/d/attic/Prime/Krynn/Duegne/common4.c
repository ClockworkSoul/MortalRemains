The common room is bustlin with activity. People are ta the bar
drinking and talking about adventures they have had. The tables
are all just about full with people eating and drinking and
grabbing a quick feel from the serving girls. In the corner there
is an entertainer juggling and telling fabulous stories for a good
sized crowd. The innkeeper stands behind the bar serving drinks, 
and to the left of the bar you see a door leading into the kitchen
and a set of stairs leading up to the rooms.
