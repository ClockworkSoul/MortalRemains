#Kyrnad whips a backfist towards your head.
You evade his primary attick, however, his counter lands squrely on your nose.

#Kyrnad says: You must think ahead and be fluid.

#Kyrnad teaches you advanced techniques, roundhouses, flying kicks. 

#Kyrnad says: Turn into a doll of wood: it has no ego, it thinks nothing,
it is not grasping or stick. Let the body and limbs workd themselves out
in accordance with the discipline they have undergone.

#Your skills become more complete, you are at peace with yourself.
