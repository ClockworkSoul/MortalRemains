mesg "Hey bud.  :)  How the hell are ya?Just wanted to make a tiny suggestion for the Ocean domain:You may want to move the various directories in /d/Ocean tosomething like /d/Ocean/Main, so that if you add other areas and/orcoders, you can give them each a /d/Ocean/Area directory, each withits own file permissions and access...  Otherwise you may have an administrative nightmare on your handseventually.  ;)-Cy------BEGIN GEEK CODE BLOCK-----Version: 3.1GCS/S/SS d- s+: a-- C++(++++)>$ UL++>++++ P L++>++++ !E W++++ N+(*) o K? w+++(---) O- M V- PS+ PE Y+ PGP+ t++ 5X++ R+ tv+ b+++ DI++ D++(--) G+ e+>+++(*) h-- r++ y++*------END GEEK CODE BLOCK------"
