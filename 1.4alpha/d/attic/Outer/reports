well, more like an idea, I was given a newbie weapon by 
Makeriham that is too large for me to wield as a Kobold.
hmm, so how do I fight anything?
I would assume that this is partially because you are

you need to make all the mobs answer to a single name
like monster or mob so we can set an alias k=kill mob
and it will kill the first thing in the room.

Wondering if there's any reason I should leave the game with a

dropped it all, & return with 3 belts.

I'm not sure this is a bug or not but ill report it just in case.
While in the Hall of Records/Bank, if I have an account and log on
I dont have a card, I get a new card by open account and it says
I have one already etc.  I think however it might make more money
appear in my account than is actually suppose to be there. Not sure 
coz I havent been keeping track of how much I have been putting in it
but it seems large, maybe I just rich and dont remember it. *grin*
Just in case, Im tellin u.   Is the non-auto bank card on purpose
or is that a bug too? FYI.  laters

Idea for Thieves,
I think there should be a cheapshot command in which in battle
one can use it to stab the oppenent.  I get too damn bored.
Think it would add life to the dying thief profession.

dunno if this is a bug....butt....
monster summoning doesn't seem to work right if you have beasts
summoned, walk into a room with something hunting you
and initiate combat
they just sit there and never
work even on diff monsters on which
you start the mob while the beasts are
in the room
kind of annoying

Something is wrong with bags
I was putting stuff to sell into a bag of holding, i probably had close
to half a million coins worth of stuff, when i went to sell it all, I 
couldnt get naything from the bag.  I got some other stuff and tried to
put it in and take it right back out and it disapeared immediately.
I got a new bag and it seemed to work ok.  I left the bag in the room
with fell and like 30 min later it was gone, Im not sure of someone
picked it up or the room reset and dested it, but I was trying to save
it for one of yall in case you could get my stuff back.
