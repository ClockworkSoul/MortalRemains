can you make a standard for these portals so that half
the rooms dont require 'enter portal' and half of them
require just 'portal'.  I like to alias the portal thing because
typing portal is too hard for me.  Either pick 1 syntax and go with it
or make sure both syntax's are equivalent.

finger is flowing right over cornugon, leaving him unaffected.

according to spellcraft theres sposed to be no saving throw from it

heartstone doesn't seem to be working quite like the spellcraft
says.  Theres 2 things ive noticed so far.  

#1.  I do not see any forms of healing that don't work.  course the only
ways i know to check are drinking, and slow healing (including using trollish).

cb
#2.  Spellcraft says that heartstone will protect me from slashing and well whatever
it says, it should also be protecting me from wounding damage.  When i kill barbazu
or cornugons with heartstone, i do not take any damage from them but still wind
up with bleeding wounds that i have to quit in order to get rid of.

also, not sure if this is a bug, but i noticed the decatur copbots can hit me despite
the heartstone, but cannot hit through stoneskin, that doesnt make a lot of sense,
what kind of damage do they do with those batons anyway?

fucking pets keep forgetting they are protecting me

Bug : Hoss at Sat Mar  4 04:51:31 2000 in /d/Planar/Baator/minauros/city15
ok, did more research on the bug from earlier.

it appears to be from foresight.

if i have foresight active and attack anything, foresight tries to fire off twice
and the monster cant hit me, while i am able to attack him. 

If I cast a spell on him, he will start to attack me again.
I think fi i command my pet to attack, he will attack the pet and when hes done
with the pet he will attack me.

also, if i leave the room and come back, he doesnt attack me.

dude, im dyin here, i wanna abuse this soooo bad and kill tiamat.  But, i know 
thats uncool, its not how i do business.  Here's how i do bidness, ive 
reported this bug .... now all i got to do is wait for u to log on at least once
then i can use the hell outta it till u get it fixed.  
as of mudtime mar 4 4:50:09 2000

Bug : Hoss at Sat Mar  4 04:59:57 2000 in /d/Planar/Baator/minauros/city15
for the record .. heres how i think foresight should work, this should
fix the aforementioned bug.  I think it should only fire off
when you are attacked.  Its kinda lame the way it works now.  I mean think aboiut it,
its supposed to be a protection from pk, and if i was going to pk someone, id prolly
wait till they were killing a monster or right after they wimpied from one.  In
that instance, foresight wouldnt do ya a dam bit of good.  It would even be allright
if it only fired off in pk, so the shadow warriors autoing me when i walk in wouldnt
set it off.


ok lesse now, i need 3 mil to level ... tiamat is worth 200k ... so id need to kill
her 15 times.  Holy geez thats gunna take forever with no spells.  I bet my
weapons wont even hit her, but rest assured i will find a way.  

Oh scuze me, my mind was wandering, ignore that last part

once players reach level 25 or something they have been playing the mud for
quite some time. That much time spent in one place tends to give
one a rather unique attachment to that place.  think that players over a certain
level , no matter what class they are, should be able to
'mark' one spot on the mud as their 'home base' so that they can 'teleport' to
that one place by expending some energy of some kind.
Obviously this will have little effect on mages who already have teleport
but for those of us who DONT this would be invaluable.
