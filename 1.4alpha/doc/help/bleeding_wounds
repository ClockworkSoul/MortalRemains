Severe bleeding wounds are an especially nasty special attack form employed
by various meanies throughout the MUD. If receive bleeding wounds, the 
amount of damage you heal every 'click' will be reduced. If the wounds are
severe enough, you will begin to lose hit points instead of healing them 
until the wounds are healed.

Bleeding wounds can be healed at the hospital, by priestly magics, or by 
quitting.
