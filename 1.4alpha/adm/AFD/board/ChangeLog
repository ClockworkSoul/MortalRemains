	* Despite what the logs might suggest, I didn't change 
	anything...just testing out an idea, which in the end, did not 
	pan out.

	* Regarding the previous ChangeLog entry (the next one, in the 
	physical format): file is /std/board/bboard.c.

	* Changed the time() element in the mapping sent to the mailer by 
	mail_note(), from "time" : time() to "date" : time(). The mailer 
	expects to find an element called "date", and was giving a date 
	of Dec 31st 1969 [i.e. ctime(0)] with mailed notes.

	* /std/board/bboard.c: added checks to see if archive_board() 
	actually made space in the bulletin board for new messages (ie 
	when board was full)

	* Broke query_short() into two functions, the first is the finding 
	of how many new messages there are, the second is the real 
	query_short(). This allows for objects to be written that can 
	determine the number of new messages on the board.

	* I got lazy with changelog... read the comments in bboard.c for 
	what's been done.  Zak, highlord bbs stuffer-upper

	* boards only save `messages[]', all other lobal vars are static. 
	num_messages is calculated on each restore_object() to ensure 
	consistancy.
