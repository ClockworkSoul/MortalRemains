mesg "We are trying to open a mud. We all have lives. This is a hobby for most of us.We would like this mud to open soon. The way i see it, the mud would be open right now if it wasnt for kyako. Why this is:1. Deciding if it was worth it to wiz him:	Cyanide bitched for 1 hour he could have been coding.	Nightmask complained for 2 hours he might have done something	Darkangel wasted 3 hours contemplating how he could make your life hellCount so far in hours lost: 62. Rediculous questions answered by people who had other things to do:	Ilzarion: 6 hours. (yes i am being realistic)	Cyanide: 8 hours.	Chronos: 2 hours.	Darkangel: 2 hours.	Nightmask: about an hour of saying to go fuck off.Count so far in hours lost: 253. Hours lost in defensive coding so you wouldnt break our mud:	Cyanide: 20 hours (this is a conservative estimate , it's probably more)	Ilzation: 1 hour	Chronos: 3 hoursCount so far in hours lost: 494. Hours lost in reading and answering STUPID e-mail:	More than the likes of me can possibly imagine.It is the descision of this admin that your productivity has not and will neveroutweigh the negative impact you have had. Simply put: you are bad for business.SO: PLAY OR GET OFF."
