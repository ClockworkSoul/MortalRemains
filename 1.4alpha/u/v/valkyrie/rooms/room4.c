A blast of intense cold hits your body as you walk in here. The entire room
is covered with ice, ornately carved with arcane patterns and runes. As 
your mind and eyes begin to become more focused on the patterns you notice
a story appearing on each wall.

As you turn around to look at the story behind you, all you can do is gasp. 
The story tells of a great battle, this battle was fought with blades 
forged from the souls of the Elder Ones. The battle lasts for many days,
with mighty blows taken on all sides. As you watch your eyes become tired,
and you never see the end. Perhaps there isn't an end; perhaps it still 
goes on. Perhaps no mortal would ever be able to watch the true power of
such a battle and live?

The eastern wall tells of a powerful dragon forced to obey an evil king
after he sliced the heads off of two of her three babies.

      "west wall" : (@EndWest
The western wall gives you a look at a peaceful glade with two lovers, 
embracing in there first, you watch enthralled by the passion reflected by
the artist.
