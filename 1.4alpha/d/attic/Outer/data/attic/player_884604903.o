At any rate here they are.   Doubles: You are allowed 2 characters, provided you don't start shit with            one and finish with the other. Any more than 2, all of you will            be purged and posibally banished.       PK:  All players that are killed will be given 5 minuites between the            next kill. This means if i kill you, you hae 5 min to get from            death seq to bank to pub and to whatever. If this dosen't happen            you will be removed or some other nasty thing i think of at the            time.     Bugs:  Bugs will be reported on finding, you are then free to exploit             them till we fix, if you don't report and exploit, you will be            dested no questions asked.   Flames:  Flame all you want. you put them on the board and your gone.
