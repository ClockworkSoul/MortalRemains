mesg "Hey, just wanted to let you know, /u/g/grull/generic_room.c is an example of an easy to use random monster generator. The only thing I can't make the monsters do is actally wear/wield an object once it's been moved to thier inventory... Could someone take a look at it and tell me why doing a 'monster_object->command(\"equip \"+ <armour name>)' isn't working?Thanks,  -Caleb"
