mesg "I wont argue with you on power cause u can see the numbers and i cant ...But i will say this, from what ive seen from killin wiht it and even playingwith a crash test dummy, two scimitars of speed are better than the katanabecase of the 3 extra attacks you get.  The Katana undoubtledly hits harderthan a scimitar, but the three extra attacks more than makes up for thatt.So that means that the only thing the katana is better on would be againstmonsters that need like a +5 on attack to hit it.  Course since i cant advance anymore, and i like the 'knick the shit outta you\" and'fuck his shit up' messages, I'm sticking with tha katana for now-take care-KM/hoss"
