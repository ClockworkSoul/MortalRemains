==================================
Ok duder,
The start of Duegne is just about done. The first room of the area
is the file  "/d/Dark/Duegne/Forest/frst1.c"  if ya want to connect
it. Let me know what it will be connected too and i will add the exit.

I have decided that it is going to be a small forest surrounding the
town of Duegne which will be mostly in ruins. The ruins will have some
underground stuff with an eventual underground link to Castle Allragons
which is going to be there as well.

In the forest will be sme firedrakes and perhaps a dragonfaeire or two. In
the toen/ruins will be some draconian type monsters. I will prolly have about
2-3 dragons in the underground area along with one who has decided to make his
residence above ground in the town itself.

The undergound will have various skeletal figures acting as guards for the 
dragons, along with some draconians as well.

The castle will prolly have a 2 dragons in it, along with a dracolich in the
dungeon/basement with prolly a few more things as well that i have not decided
upon. The town and forest will be my main concern for now with the castle and
the underground connection to the two coming later.

If ya have ideas or imput about it...feel free to let me know.
Hope this at least gives ya some idea of what I have planned  >;)

Catch ya aound boss

Raist,
Dark Lord of Duegne
