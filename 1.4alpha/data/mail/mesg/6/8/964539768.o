mesg "Concerning classes:What changes to you guys think we shoul make to each class to makethem more balanced? Here's a few ideas of mine, which may or maynot suck.Mages - Reduce the # of SP's at higher levels. Reduce the power of        damage spells somewhat. Delay higher level spell access        to higher levels.Thieves - Allow greater weapon skill. Add more \"miscellaneous\"         abilities to give non- combat or indiret advantages.Warrior - Chronos is taking care of sharpshooters. What do we do        about pit fighters? Special attacks? What kind?Priests - Let's make these guys actually WORK...Thoughts? Anybody?-Cy-Sleep: A completely inadequate substitute for caffeine."
