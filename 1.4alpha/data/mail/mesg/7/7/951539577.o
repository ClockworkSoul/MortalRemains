mesg "I think i know what my sig spell is.I'm thinking i call in artillary fire, or maybe call in sorties.  If its sorties, itwould be a jet coming to my aid, and it could drop different payloads to do diffkinds of damage.  Like napalm, exploding shells, bullets, maybe even some kind ofenergy beam (futuristic jets here)but the big thing is i want it to do like 1k damage.I was thinking making it do Random (1000) + 500 so it would everage around 1k damage.I was also thinking that it might be unfair in pk, so maybe u could add in a linecast mordswordwield swordwhere it only does that much damage to monsters with 1500 or more hps.  For lowerones or for players, instead it would just do Random ((TP_Query_Attacker)_Query_Max_Hps)or whatever in the hell that function is to query the max hps of yer attacker.Oh wait, for a damage calc i guess ud just need (TP_Query_Max_Hps) cause itd alreadybe looking at the person u casted it on.anyway, u get the idea .... i think thats what i want, mail me back and tell mewhat the drawbacks would have to be for a spell like that.-thanks-hossPS ignore those bug reports about my pet not giving xp, evidently it prolly was givingme xp, i just wasnt seeing any messages.  Bomber told me to chack my actual xpto see that it is getting added"
