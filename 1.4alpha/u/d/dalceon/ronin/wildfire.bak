The Armour of Wildfire was born from the heart of a volcano.  It glows a fiery
red. The armour has two small shoulder pads that slope down to protect the 
shoulders.  It has two larger shoulder shields that flare out to the sides.
There are two giant yellow diamonds on either shoulder front that helps to add
to the deceptively beautiful facade of the armour.  The chest shield is big,
red, and more than enough to handle attacks from your enemies.
