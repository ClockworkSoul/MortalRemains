Just let me know which character you would like promoted.You are still allowed to play with you other character under thecondition that your wizard and player may never interact in ANY way(which includes dropping money in a distant location for laterdiscovery. ;) )This rule extends to all players (excluding test characters), and isour most central law.-Cyanide-Sleep: A completely inadequate substitute for caffeine."
