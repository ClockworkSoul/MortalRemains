mesg "How to add actions to a room:The add_action string is just what adds all the fun to a room. The following is an example of how it works:ClassroomThis is a computer lab in which all the computers are producingweird sounds. There are ten computers, from which five are macs, and five are ibm. A black board is hanging on the wall.         Obvious exit is eastexa computersThe computers are busy. Each one is downloading stuff...exa boardA blackboard. It has some instructions written. You can'read' them.read instructions      HOW TO USE AN ILLEGAL PROGRAM:1. First.....blah blah blah2. Blakufyrejfhdfjkhv[idfhborithqkrhjgoi[dfblkd3. ;isdrybnmlgfkjbfglhrtlkjho[ij rofblrg'howrojbNow that you understand them, use the computers...*Note that the exa thing is what you do with the item_desk string.When you have to write something diferent to 'exa' or 'look', that's whenyou use the add_action thing.  The 'read instructions' is an add_action.and this is how you do it:void init () {add_action(\"read_board\", \"read\");}int read_board (string str) {if (!str || str!=\"board\") {write (\"What do you want to read?\\n\");return 1;}say(TPN+\" reads the instructions in the blackboard.\\n\");write(wrap(\"      HOW TO USE AN ILLEGAL PROGRAM:\\n\"+\"1. First.....blah blah blah\\n\"+\"2. Blakufyrejfhdfjkhv[idfhborithqkrhjgoi[dfblkd\\n\"+\"3. ;isdrybnmlgfkjbfglhrtlkjho[ij rofblrg'howrojb\\n\"+\"Now that you understand them, use the computers...\\n\"));return 1;}*Look at the \"say\" string. You'll see it's a single and short line.Now look at the \"write\" one. Because it's more than one line, I addedthe 'wrap(' thing. As you know, each line must not have more than 70characters. If something must be added, you must do it the way I madethe example.If you start it like this: write(wrap(notice it has two of this: (   , one after write, and one after wrap.Same way you must end it.  That's why it ends like this: \\n\"));*Notice that each line ends with this: \\n\"+that means end of sentence, but continues in other line.And one more thing, I made a mistake in the example. Remember I startedit with \"read instructions\" ?  I accidentally changed it to \"read board\".Make sure that doesn't happen to you :)This is your today's lesson. I hope you're practising all this.-Lady Nsd"
