mesg "There aren't any descriptions for 'snow', 'ice', 'pond', 'trees', or 'igloo'.  As a thought instead of telling what they see in the room descriptions, why notset an item 'south' so when i exa south i get a message sayingthat i see some snow covered trees. This would hold true for each of theseroom and each of these N/S directions.Enzyme"
