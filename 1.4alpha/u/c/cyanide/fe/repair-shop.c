You are in a small building that is barely standing.  Many chips and
circuit boards lay on the work bench, waiting to be repaired.  In the
corner, a computer screen is displaying the diagnostics of some machine.
A broken chassis is resting on one of the tables.  This is where broken
machines are taken to be repaired.  If you need to connect to a new
body, type <body> and a new one will be provided for you.
A sign is taped to the work bench.
