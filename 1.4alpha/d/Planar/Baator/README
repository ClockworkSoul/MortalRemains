Almost everything in this area was originally conceived of by
Ilzarion@Nightfall's Keep, but was done quickly and sloppily.

All clean-up work was done by Cyanide@Mortal Remains over a 
period of several months.

The layers are as follows:
 1 - Avernus (Bel)
 2 - Dis (Dispater)
 3 - Minauros (Minauros)
 4 - Phlegethos (Fierana)
 5 - Stygia (Levistus)
 6 - Malbolge (Malagard)
 7 - Maladomini (Triel)
 8 - Cania (Molikroth)
 9 - Nessus (Vacna)

To date the following has been completed:
All monsters are fully optimized.

Layers 1 - 4 are fully updated
Layers 5 - 7 still use old (Ilzarion) code
Layers 8 - 9 are unstarted.
