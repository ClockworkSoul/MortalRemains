This is the best map i could come up with using ed.

The spot on the map labelled t_s.c coresponds to town_square.c, and
the ones labelled hs1.c through hs6.c corespond to house1.c etc...
And shp.c = shop.c....
One more thing, this map was not made to show which rooms connect to which,
it merely outlines the basic area for those that find my method of naming
files to be confusing.

                  hs1.c sn3.c hs2.c
                        sn2.c
            pub.c       sn1.c shp.c h3.c
zw4.c zw3.c zw2.c zw1.c t_s.c ze1.c ze2.c ze3.z
                  hs4.c ss1.c       hs5.c
                        ss2.c hs6.c
                      shrine1.c
