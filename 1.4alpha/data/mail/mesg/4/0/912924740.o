mesg "Your sarcasim is wasted on me.The rule is there for the following reasons1. You flame, they flame back, this in turn puts many usless notes   on the board, all of which i have to read in order to look for shit that    might mean somthing.2. No one really cares what you have to say in regards to flames.   You can: shout, tell, say, and mail them to the player, You don't   have to post that typr of bs.Also, I don't think you realize who you mailed this to. You talking down at meis no way to get ahead here.-Nightmask Admin of Law_"
