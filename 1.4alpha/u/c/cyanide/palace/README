This is the eventual layout of the palace. My workroom will be
On the third floor of the spire, where there are 2 rooms. The
first will be a large sumoning circle, where uninvited people
get bounced. Through a locked door will be my workroom.

The courtyard will be taken from the Thylassa Garden of area3
and the Topiary region of area2.
