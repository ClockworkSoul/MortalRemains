there is two taverns in slushville, one west and north of town centre
one, east along a road, south and west, but both have the same exit from
them...so the two pubs are like one room, instead of two seperate rooms

I found an interesting bug with the steal command. If someone is a statue you can steal from them. If you fuck up is says a fight begins, but then nothing happens. So you can hide again and try to lift the goods off the link dead goon.

u need to make a way so we can tell what spells we have active
rather than having to try to recast them all b4 every fight


Idea : Hoss at Sat Nov  7 20:09:41 1998 in /d/Prime/Toril/Arabel/rooms/tower/grave18
you need some way fo telling how long it is till the next reboot like either
on who or by typing time etc...  I just spent over 20k equipping and as soon
as i did i got the 1 hr notice, im not gunna have time to even break even
today, if id have know reboot was so soon i woulda killed smaller stuff with
lesser equipment.

for ilzarion, if u cant make it so the elementals dont just stop protecting you,
how about making it possible to dismiss them, or how about if we resummon
them, they start fighting again.

Bug : Marcus at Fri Dec  4 04:24:29 1998 in /d/Prime/Toril/Arabel/rooms/tower/grave1
ummmm....
i don't think it works on all mobs
but on some mobs
you can use a "do" sequence (or a fast alias i would assume...
i'm using telnet as my client so i don't have aliases or triggers)
to run in, spell amob, and run out without taking dmg.
thot i'd give ya the heads up

1) the guards don't hunt, don't know if that's a bug though
2) if there are guards to the east for example, it is possible
to run the command string e, cast fireball at guard, w and get
the fireball off but not get hit
