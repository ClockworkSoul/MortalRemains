	Suffer not yourselves to be carried with the Great Stream, but
stem the tide, you that can lay hold of the Haven of safety, and make
your full course toward it.  Seek one that may lead you by the hand,
and conduct you to the door of Truth and Knowledge, where the clear
Light is that is so pure from Darkness, where there is not one drunken,
but all are sober, and in their heart look up to him, whose pleasure it
is to be seen.
	--The Sacred Pymander of Hermes Trismegistus, VIII. 4-5
