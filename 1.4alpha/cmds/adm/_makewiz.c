//
// User to promote a player to wizard status. Alters their path to give
// them wizard commands and set their wizard property to 1. Can only be used
// by admins.
// Written by Mobydick@TMI, 11-25-92. Copied most of it from the changepath
// command.
// 93-02-11 Pallando changed WIZPATH to use <config.h>
// 93-02-28 Watcher changed wizard flag set from body to connection
//  	    and allowing promotion when target is not online.
// 93-07-22 Pallando moved the define of NEW_WIZ_PATH to config.h
// 95-11-11 Leto protected makewiz against forced attempts through 
//          add_action
// 97-06-11 Cyanide added makewiz logs.
