mesg "Probably the best, and easiest way to make monsters wear armor and equipweapons is arm() and wear() from the monster object itself..They are both formatted the same way:  arm(file_name, object_id) ;Try that.  ie - 'monster_object->arm(file_name, object_id) ;Don't even need to clone the object and move it to the monster object,the arm and wear functions do it for you."
