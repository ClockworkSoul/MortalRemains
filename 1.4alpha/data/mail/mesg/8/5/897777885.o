mesg "We've been having some small problems with experience, so I did the following:1 - \"experience\" cannot be set directly. Do this:     call object;add_experience;2000      (Would add 2000 xp to object)2 - If the experience is called by anything other than a kill,    it appends a log file (/log/adm/add_experience). I did this    mainly for Kyakoisms.    Also adds to the log file if xpv  is greater than 100k. Same    reason.-C"
