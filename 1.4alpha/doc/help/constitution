A character's Constitution stat encompasses his physique, fitness, health,
and physical resistance to hardship, injury, and disease. Since this 
ability affects the characetr's hit points and chances of surviving such
tremendous shocks as being physically reshaped by magic, it is vitally 
important to all classes. Some classes have minimum allowable
Constitution scores.
