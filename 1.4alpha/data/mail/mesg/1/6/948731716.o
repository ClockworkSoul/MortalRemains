THe rules are very specific,a wizard with a player may not even help his own player, if theplayer isn't a test character. .That's one of the few things I am very strict about..Though I appreciate you asking me. Just remember, a wizard may not interfere with a player,no matter who's player it is, except in cases where the player is affected by something the wizard did (like code a room without exits for example) by accident.-Cy"
