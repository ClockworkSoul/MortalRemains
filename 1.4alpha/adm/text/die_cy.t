Driver Parody###
You find yourself wandering outside of your body.  You look down and
see your dead body.  You immediately think, "This bites ass."
###
You find it hard to resist floating up... up... up.
###
You float to the top of what appears to be a mountain.  There, standing
all alone, is a man dressed in a long black cloak and robes, wielding
a glowing sickle.
###
Death says [to you]: State your business here!  Oh.. heh.  My bad, you're
dead ain't ya.
###
Death looks at some papers.  Death looks at you.
###
Death says [to you]: You mortals make me sick; always dying and shit.
Death says [to you]: How fucking hard is it to stay alive????!!!
###
Death says: Bah, fuck the paper work, I am just gonna remove you.
###
The floor begins to bleed, and Cyanide appears from the blood.
###
Cyanide raises one eyebrow at Death.
Cyanide chuckles to you.
###
Death bows to Cyanide.
###
Cyanide says [to Death]: What have I told you about not telling me
	when Mortals die, Death?
Death says [to Cyanide]: Umm.. to always let you know?
###
Cyanide nods at Death.
###
Cyanide turns to you and casts a spell, you begin to shimmer and fade
out, as you start to feel yourself move.
###
Cyanide punches Death right in the head, blood squirts from Death's
head, as he falls backwards.  He screams in agony.
Cyanide melts into the floor.
###
You find yourself elsewhere.
