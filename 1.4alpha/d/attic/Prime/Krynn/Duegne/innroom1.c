You stand in one of the inns rooms. It is a quaint little room
with a bed to your left, a small firplace in the wal opposite
the door and to your right lies a small writing table and a
closet to han clothes. This room looks to belong to one of the
patrons downstairs so you might want to leave before they get 
back.
