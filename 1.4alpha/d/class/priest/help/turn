Turn:  (Priest Command)

This command allows the priests of certain deities to summon the
divine might of their god to attempt to destroy the repugnant
undead who dare to insult life simply by existing.

It's power and scope is directly affected by the level of the 
priest and the level of the undead creature being affected.
