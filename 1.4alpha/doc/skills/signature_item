Signature Item      (General)
Required Level: 20

Signature item makes an item in your inventory your personal
trademark. Though it can still be destroyed, it will always return
when next you log in. It autoloads to you and can not be dropped,
sold or given away.
You can spend another 2 slots to change a sig item, but you may only
have 1. So choose wisely. Also, make sure you dont make a mistake
in choosing. (Emptying your inventory of all but the item you want
helps.) Syntax when coosing is as follows:
select signature item sword 2
would select sword 2 in your inventory as your signature item.
