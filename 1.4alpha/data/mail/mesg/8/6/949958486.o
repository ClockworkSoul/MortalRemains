mesg "perhaps I won't be online tonight to meet you for the complicated changes I talked to you about. But I hope we can do them tomorrow. And about the pool for players, I have a better idea. I'll make a similar room that connects to the frescoes of the pool. That similar room will be another dimension (the wicked version of the pool) which will have demon graffitti in the walls instead of angel frescoes, and when players open the portal from the frescoes, some gang boys with hockey masks enter from the wicked dimension and start to attack all the players in the pool area. I'll make them for mid levels. I'll talk to you more about it when we coincide in logging. See ya soonATTLady NSD"
