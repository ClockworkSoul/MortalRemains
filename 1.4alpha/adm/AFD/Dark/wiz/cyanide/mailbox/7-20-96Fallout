Subject: Hell and the necro guild
==================================
Ok welll. here is my idea..

OK the necromancers guild will be located in one corner of Hell.
Hell will have 3 or 4 levels with the lower levels having monsters
for easyier monsters to kill and the top level having aggressive
and VERY dangerious monsters including Satan.

Hell will be a branch off area of Dark, It will be reached by a
portal. Members of the necromancers guild will start in the guild.
The guild will be located early in Hell. Some areas in Hell will be
blocked by some difficult monsters. A few of the monsters in hell
will have some Magic abilities they can use. There will also be 
a quest there.. Kill Satan and behead him. 

Another idea to get to hell is to enter an astral plain. Where depending
on your alignment you enter Hell or Heaven.

Lemmie know what you think
