mesg "Coolies.As per weather - I was going to ask you if you could take a look atit, and maybe try to find a way to make it somewhat efficient. Wemay want to have ALOT of weather types here - so if you can find away to make it work from just a couple different callouts, it wouldbe great.Universal verbs not in yet...   Put it on the bug board, if you would, could you?  Any suggestions at all should go there.  It's kindof our all-access todo list.Orb: cool.					-Cyanide"
