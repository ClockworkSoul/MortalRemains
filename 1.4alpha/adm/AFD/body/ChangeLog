	* /std/body/attack.c: Changed the return value of kill_ob() from 0 
	to 2, when one of the users has no_attack set. This allows the 
	correct message in /cmds/std/_kill.c. 

Mon Oct 24 08:34:23 1994   Leigh Caldwell   (Blue at phdsa.tp.ph.ic.ac.uk)

	* attack.c: Added a check for both victim and attacker to be 
	users, and either one to have "no_attack" set. If it is the 
	case, don't let the attack take place. This is #ifdef'd on a 
	NO_PKILL define. (in config.h). 

Mon Jul 25 18:56:48 1994   GD Hack II   (Inspiral at mulberry.wustl.edu)

	* /std/body/more.c: Made exec_cmd() static, as anyone could do 
	this  call <admin>;exec_cmd;<cmd to do damage and stuff>;  

Tue Apr 12 04:25:53 1994   Anthon Pang   (Robocoder at annex4.net.ubc.ca)

	* /std/body/wild_card.c: slight optimization, code prettied up, 
	and some comments added. 

Sun Apr 10 04:33:25 1994   Anthon Pang   (Robocoder at mindlink.bc.ca)

	* /std/body/alias.c: mods for removal of <alias.h> 

Wed Apr  6 04:58:32 1994   Anthon Pang   (Robocoder at mindlink.bc.ca)

	* /std/body/more.c: changed "<return>\t\tDisplay next line" to 
	"...next page". 

Sat Aug  7 01:19:21 1993   Anthon Pang   (Robocoder at 137.82.63.11)

	* attack.c: now checks if BLOCK_ATTACK #defined (see 
	/include/config.h); this allows sites to disable block_attack() 
	in the combat code; (it's still called...but it'll just return 
	without doing anything, if #undef'd) 

Fri Jul 30 08:34:27 1993   Tony Brannigan   (Grendel at black.ox.ac.uk)

	* Moved more.c~ and wild_card.c~ to /std/attic
