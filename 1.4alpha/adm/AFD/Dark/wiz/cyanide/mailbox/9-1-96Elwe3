==================================
Since I do not have access to the daemons, I cannot fully advise on
the "fix" of this next problem.  Players, when first created, do not have
any skills to call upon for fighting other than "Wilderness".

No skills == very easy to kill
I like the idea behind the /include/skills.h .... cudos

However, I think it would be beneficial to have players have SOME
skills.... maybe race dependent.  Since there are only 3 types
of fighting weapons .. blunt, thrusting and cutting .. if there
are more, please let me know, but those are the only one's that I've
run across .. and then we have our defense ... Shield defense and 
Parrying defense. ... A player should have one or the other of
these at a limited quantity as well .. 

What do you think?
