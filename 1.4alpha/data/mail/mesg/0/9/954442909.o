remain ({"emergency",})
mesg "okie, hopefully everyone leaves me alone for a few minutes so thatI can finish this from last night.I lost my access to my puter at work last week, that is why I am neveron anymore.  I also lost the modem in my puter at home (traded it toa friend for a rack for my bike) but I did manage to get my puter athome to stay running for more than 10 minutes.  So I might get a newmodem there.  ANYWAY, as of right now I dont have access to work on theweb page except for on my roomates puter but those sessions are few andfar between.  I hope to have this problem remedied soon, either by gettinga puter at work or something at home.Raven.I have gotten a few more pics and what not to put on the page though."
