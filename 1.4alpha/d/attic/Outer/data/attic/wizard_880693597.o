If there's a crash, however...You know the deal with that stuff.SOME stuff (not much) autodests when it gets sold, but not alot ofit at all.We recently had a problem with the shop (my bad).  Theres a definition in the standard shop which states maximum number of eachitem that may exist in any one particular shop at each time. WhenI reset it from 20 to 10, I mispelled the #define, so it defaultedto 0.  SO...  it said you sold it, but it dested it instead of placing itin the shop.Oops.-Cyanide","time":879220769,"poster":"Cyanide","title":"Re: shop",]),(["title":"shops","poster":"Knightmare","time":879232405,"body":"It's not that, cause im seeing the stuff in the shop ... but i logout an bak in a few hrs later and its gone.  i agree wiff woobie, itmust be resettign too often.-KM","id":111,]),(["id":112,"body":"when is it going to work?!?just curious. woob","time":879288261,"poster":"Woobie","title":"party",]),(["title":"Party/shop","poster":"Cyanide","time":879310615,"body":"Shop is fixed.Mass and capacity are fixed.Party will work soon.
