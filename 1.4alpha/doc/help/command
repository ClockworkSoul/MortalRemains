Whenever you summon or animate a create, you are able to
'command' it to perform various acts. For example, one of the
first things you will often do is:
   
    command foo protect cyanide

Of course, that would only work if you summoned a foo, and your
name, in fact, is Cyanide. I'm sure you get the point.

Other things you may command your follower to do include, but
are not limited to:

   kill, wield, drop, get, equip
