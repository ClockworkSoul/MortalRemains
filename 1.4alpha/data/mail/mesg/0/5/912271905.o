mesg "We had Mega test advancement. He found that Most classes wereaboiut right, gettering to level 5 in like 1.5 hours. In the sametime he got a fighter to level 11, and thats taking snack breaks.They need to be slowed down a little. Now there's a few thingsthat fighters have to improve their abilities for which otherclasses have no equivalent:1 - Many multiple attacks. A level 17 fighter (3 hours old, mind    you) was seen with 7 attacks. Note, 4 base (not the max),    and two scimitars of speed (+1 for extra weapon, and +1 for    each scimitar).2 - Stat based power. 7 or 8 attacks is bad enough, but the     fighters power is based on his strength. Please note that the    only stat that is easy to increase to 19, is strength. I'm    yet to see a fighter without it.3 - Fighters have to make fewer runs, along with their massive    attack output, due to their massive con bonus. No other class    has this either, and it adds HUGE amounts of hp's.     The concept of con bonus is very over-emphicized. It does    too much, simply put.I suggest we:   Slow down multiple attacks for a NUMBER of reasons   Get rid of \"fighter con bonus\". and give everybody the same     for the same con.   If necessary, increase the fighters xp requirement a bit.Votes? -C"
