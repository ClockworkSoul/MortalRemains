The cats that auto wont die. They will however keep killing you and i have
died twice because of it. Not too happy about the deaths. and Im thinking that
there is a bigger bug at work here than just in this area.

To Nightmask:  RE: Sharpshooters...

	My idea is that we get some kind of 'Spell' and i use the term loosely
that allows us to have greater accuracy when using a weapon befitting
our guild. ie: when I wield a 'gun' I can cast an accuracy spell that gives me
bonuses to hit and to dammage for the durration of the 'spell'. 

Just my 2 cents,

Players and wizzes shouldn't be allowed to dammage/take dammage from each other
this is, in my opinion, a rather large bug.  I was testing it out last night
and I actualy was hurting and almost killing a wizard, who at this time will
remain nameless, as the point here is just to identify a problem not incriminate
others.

once players reach level 25 or something they have been playing the mud for
quite some time. That much time spent in one place tends to give
one a rather unique attachment to that place.  think that players over a certain
level , no matter what class they are, should be able to
'mark' one spot on the mud as their 'home base' so that they can 'teleport' to
that one place by expending some energy of some kind.
Obviously this will have little effect on mages who already have teleport
but for those of us who DONT this would be invaluable.

when i use the 'attackall' feature for fighters with serena, I am basically
stunning myself for 4 or 5 rounds. This renders me useless in melee against her
until the duration of the attack wears off.  Could someone look into this please?
thanks

Not really a typo, but a suggestion:
make the hammock swing

Bug : Beetlejuice at Tue Jul 25 20:27:22 2000 in /d/class/warrior/pit_fighter/rooms/pitfighterguild
in my 'skills
 list "iron Will" is only listed as 1 non weapon slot, however in the
guild itis listed as 2 slots.  Which is correct?

I'm almost positive this has been bugged before, but i'm doin it again. If you make an alias to do e, cast a spell at dealer, w... you can keep running in and out and he doesnt hit you back.

when you sit on the hammock, it says "sit down in" instead of "sit
down on"   and the commands are a little weird. For example:
You don't "sit hammock", you "sit on hammock". Same on 'flop' and
'swing'.  Change them to "flop on hammock"... ah wait, swing you can
change it to simply "swing" instead of "swing hammock". And include
the 'swing' command in the item desc for the hammock. Just a few 
suggestions from someone that knows an awful lot and needs to transfer
that knowledge to whomever. I'm not gonna last forever.

awareness is broke.  Beetlejuice is like at least 10 levels lower than me and
he claimed he coulc still see me on the who list when i was invisible.

Whats more, he claims he knew i was in the room when all i was doing was watching
the battle.

When I tried to wear a shield, it said I couldn't due to having two weapons.  I unwielded my one weapon and then wore it and rewielded the blade and it allowed it.

Ok, it appears that the hide and backstab commands under thelp does not work.  When you type backstab, it gives the '
You're not hidden...  that target will see you coming!' message and when you hide, it does say you hide but you can not backstab as it gives you the same message.   According to the thelp, a thief can hide and backstab both at level 1.

In the sewers, the description reads:  the smell is horendous.   The correct spelling of the word is HORRENDOUS.   I checked it against Webster's as well.

Ok, again in the sewers.   The next line:  hope its just water.   Websters and I agree it should be IT'S, the contraction for it is.
