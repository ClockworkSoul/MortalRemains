mesg "Draconis,     Due to the amount of work you have been putting into   Nightfall's Keep lately, the administration has decided    to promote you to the Layer Lord in charge of the Krynn   area.  As such, you would be responsible for the direction   of the other Krynn coders (whenerver we get some :) and   the general maintainance of that area (which would include   things like recruiting people to the area and telling Zur,   the Domain Lord, when somebody isn't working out, so that   they can be removed from the domain.                                       Congrats,    					Cyanide"
