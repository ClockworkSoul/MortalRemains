mesg "i have re-evaluated the combat code and come up with an answeri realize the balance from d&d is thrown off(yeah yeah, my fault i admit)so in the interest of purity and game balance:i am TOTally d&d izing the attacks1:fighter attacks per round:bracket 1: 3/22 : 2/13: 5/2oops , thats specialistsbase fighters (expertise):1: 12: 3/23: 2/1best u can get (mastery):bracket 1: 3/2bracket 2: 2/1bracket 3: 5/2bracket 4: 7/2(only grand mastery gives you another attack)I will count half attacks in the system as a +4 damage bonus that will go away when you have an even bracket(+4 being lots less than a half attack, unless you are zero str bonusand have just a long sword)also : i am taking out natt bonus for weap2 (you only ever get +1 attack from an off weapon)what this means:max # attacks on the mud:3/1 base, +1 scimitar, +1 xtra weap.5/1 , a reduction of 2 att per round totalalso this reduction hits mostly at low lvl comparitivelyso it should slo down adv."
