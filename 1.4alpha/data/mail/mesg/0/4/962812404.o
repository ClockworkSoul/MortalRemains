mesg "Hey bro...   Shya says she fixed a bunch of stuff in her area(located in /d/Arctic/Shya).If you could, I need you to go through that area room by room and findevery link that doesn't make sense, and every monster that doesn't pass QC,etc...  if you have that bit of extra time (and sadism) maybe you couldbe a real bugger about descriptions, which are lacking at best.When you're done, mail the list to her and cc it to 'lords'?Thanks bro... -Cy-Sleep: A completely inadequate substitute for caffeine."
