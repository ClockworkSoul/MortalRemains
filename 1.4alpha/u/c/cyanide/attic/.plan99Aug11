            ** It is by caffeine alone I set my mind in motion. **
            **   It is by the beans of Java that the thoughts   **
            **     acquire speed, the hands acquire shakes,     **
            **         the shakes become a warning.             **
            ** It is by caffeine alone I set my mind in motion. **
