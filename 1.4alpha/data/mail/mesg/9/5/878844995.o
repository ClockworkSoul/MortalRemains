mesg "You like me?Bad news though: mages can't wear some kinds of armor anymore.  :((Which doesn't matter - shield doesn't combine with worn that kind of worn armor, and the shield spell is excellent anyway.)Oh, I wanted to ask you, have you found the hidden portal to Baatoryet?  Some good kills down there.If not, here's how you find it:  From Makeriham, go all south, 1 east.  Buy an arm, (the gate key).  Go to the foundry (where Tarholt is), go all north.  As long as you have the arm, going 1s from there will put you in    Avernus, the first layer of Baator.  ;)"
