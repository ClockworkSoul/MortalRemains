I understand that there may be other moreimportaint things to deal with, however this is something that I feel IS importaintand should be dealt with.

Heart of Stone has been made so youtake 1-3 hit points of damage from any cutting, slashing, or piercingattack (that is to say, most weapons). Neither spell works at all against things like fire, force, cold, or electricity. (They never have,either).As for the borg, I'll look to make sure they haven't accidentallybeen granted too many attacks.The level 5 monsters: many of them have weapons that do \"alternative:types of damage.-Cyanide","id":18,]),(["id":19,"body":"The problem with summoning creatures that we've been having should be fixed.
