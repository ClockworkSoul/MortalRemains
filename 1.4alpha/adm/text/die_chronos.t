Nightmask said I could. -c. ###
You find yourself wandering outside of your body.  You look down and
see your dead body.  You immediately think, "This bites ass."
###
You find it hard to resist floating up... up... up.
###
You float to the top of what appears to be a mountain.  There, standing
all alone, is a man dressed in a long black cloak and robes, wielding
a glowing sickle.
###
Death says [to you]: State your business here!
###
Death says [to you]: Oh.. heh.  My bad, you're dead, ain't ya?
###
Death looks at some papers.  Death looks at you.
###
Death says [to you]: You mortals make me sick; always dying and shit.
Death says [to you]: How fucking hard is it to stay alive????!!!
###
Death says: Bah, fuck the paper work, I am just gonna remove you.
###
Death grabs you by the back of the head.
###
Death opens a hatch marked "ASSHOLE".
###
Death says: This is where I'm going to put you.
###
Suddenly, Chronos climbs out of the hatch.
###
Chronos dusts himself off and grins cheesily.
Death says [to Chronos]: Who the fuck are you?
###
Chronos says [to Death]: Don't get your panties into a twist.  I just got lost
	and ended up here.
###
Death glares at Chronos.
Death says: Well whoever the hell you are, get out of here!  I have to deal
	with this dead jerk over here.
Death points at you.
###
Chronos looks at you.
Chronos says: That one?
###
Death nods solemnly.
###
Death says: That one is going into the Abyss.
###
Chronos whistles.
Chronos says: Sounds rough.
###
Death says: It's the worst.
Death grins evilly at you.
###
Chronos whispers something to Death.
Death looks pissed.
###
Death says: The hell you are!
Death swings his scythe at Chronos.
###
Chronos ducks under the deadly arc of Death's scythe and jabs him in the
balls.
Death doubles over in pain, moaning.
###
Chronos exclaims: Cool, Death has balls!
###
Chronos powerbombs Death into the floor violently and goes for the pin.
###
1... 2... 3!!
Chronos raises his hands in victory as Death fades away.
###
Chronos says [to you]: You know.. I really have no use for you.  Why don't 
	you just get lost and go do whatever it is you mortals do down there?
He makes a simple gesture and ...
###
You awaken in a small temple with a throbbing headache.
