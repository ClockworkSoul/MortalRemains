*******************PLAN*******************
Enter the Outcast, the stage has been set
A moment of glory, our eyes first met
To challange the masses, of what they believe
To shelter a love which none dare concieve
I shadow your soul, like a blanket of snow
An ocean of emotion, I dare not show
But there in the distance, my sanctuary near
To shield from a love, so sweet so clear
