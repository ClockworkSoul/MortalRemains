Justarm(\"pathname\"); Works exactly the same way, regardless ofwhether or not the item is actually a weapon.Also, if you wanted, you could use the wear() func...At any rate, we don't need to add the new func. Wealready have something similar.-Cy-Sleep: A completely inadequate substitute for caffeine."
