mesg "heya hon;I hope your mother is ok, and you too.About wizzing, I'm having a lot of fun coding a lot of new cool stuff.As soon as I finish my area, I'll let you test it. I know you'll be laughing with some things. BTW, I still owe you a pict of me as a high-school tom-boy rocker. I'm looking for the perfect one, big enough to scan it. That was the season of my life in which I hated picts, so there's no much to chose from. And I owe you the mud b-day gift too. Geez, I'm delinquent (owing too many things at once).Well, see ya next time we log on.Yours;Lady NSD.PS.I'm mud-cheating on you with Cyanide. But he and me only flirt. (I won't go with him as far as I go with you). *rofl* ;-)"
