We moved the machine from Burlington on the last possible day (Nov. 30). Burlington's cable provider is MediaOne. Bedford's provider is Cablevision. The former provided cablemodem internet service. The latter does NOT. I looked into DSL service, but it wasn't cost-effective. Instead, I'm paying a friend of mine $15/month to run my machine off his cablemodem (that's the charge from MediaOne for additional IPs). This means that when something goes wrong, I have to leave work, and drive 15-20 minutes before I can diagnose the problem. To compound things, it looks like there's a bug in either my network card or the default linux network driver (3c905). When the card loses link for some reason, it refuses to re-acquire link unless you power down. I'm looking into a new card, but it'll take some time.In the meanwhile, bear with us. Hopefully, my town will start supporting cable access soon (in a few months, they keep telling us).I'll try to keep eveyone more up to date with current happenings.  -Grull","id":27,]),(["title":"Re: www page","poster":"Cyanide","time":947999784,"body":"On Fri Jan 14, Raven wrote:> Think that I am taking on the challenge of getting a more... ahem...> how shall I put this....
