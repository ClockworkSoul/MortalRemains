mesg "Hey loren, my name is kevin and i live in houston, tx and i'm interestedin learning/helping out with this mud.  now, you don't know me from adambut i was lookin at the home page and the ideas are really cool hereso i thought i'd check it out.I'm used to playing on a DIKU codebase and i have a shit load of experiencehacking and slashing big, ugly monsters but now i'm looking to team up withsome other guys to start my own mud.  Just looking at this mud at a glance,i can tell that we're gonna need some helpfiles. for instance, it wouldbe nice to have a command just called help. that could bring up an indexof topics. then the helps could narrow from there with references likeSEE HELP COMBAT and whatnot.Let's see, i'm 18 yrs old and a freshman at Texas A&M university so i have lotsof time to waste :)if you guys want an extra pair of hands to add color (one of my specialties)or write some helpfiles and some nice commands like \"inventory\" or \"score\"i'd like to hear back from you.  in case you didn't get my e-mail addressit's   kevin2@swbell.netif i don't hear anything back from you, i'll assume i should just buggar off."
