==================================
Hello, I met Waxer on another mud where he was recruiting for people to
help create areas for the mud. I have coded before (sneezy) and I would
like to get back into it. It's been a while, but I enjoyed it and would
like to do it again. my email is 954powell@alpha.nlu.edu

thanks,
Jimmy Powell
