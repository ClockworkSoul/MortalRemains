None of them inherit SPELL or usethe spell cast_spell() func.  Ever noticed that the spells youcoded are castable infinitely?I guess not.> This is the way it should be:> Anybody can put anything in if they are admin.> (hell, if nm wants a weapon that does a bizzillion damage, fuckin go 4 it)> then, if it is found to be a problem through PLAYTESTING (perish the thought)> then we will ALL agree to remove it!> i will accept nothing less.Accept it. I worked long and hard on my stuff. People attachmy name to the mages. I will accept no cookie-cutter-crap in thatdirectory. For me, it is unacceptable to see:You begin casting.Cyanide begins casting.You know like your shit does?Have I EVER edited your shit without permission?  EVER?> <and the driver dont yell at me for my sloppy code, so neither should you>> > ps, i deleted your home directory.> hope you backed it up.It's nice to see you have some spunk in ya, bud. ;)But honestly, we both agreed not to edit one anothers things without asking firstm and I was upset. I consider that guild tobe very much my property, more in spirit than actuality. I worked very hard on it, and perhaps I'm a bit territorial.Now can we both grow up a little?-C"
