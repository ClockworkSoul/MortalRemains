Utter blackness is your only company in this room. Black stone walls, 
black floor and ceiling, and black eyes, hovering directly before you.
They say to you, "Welcome to your doom! Oh wait, wrong mortal. Be gone,
you. I do not have time for one as small as yourself! Come back later when
your strongest blow could even get past my first shield."
