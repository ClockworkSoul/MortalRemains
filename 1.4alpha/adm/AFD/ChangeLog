Wed Aug 30 14:46:13 1995   Jason.   (Chronos at freeside.scsd.k12.ny.us)

	* Removed it completely - in /std/attic. You don't need it! 1 coin 
	system in place. 

Mon Nov 28 23:40:26 1994   And if I don't, what then?   (Mobydick at 192.52.218.45)

	* in user.c, query("name") was returning 0 a lot. I changed it to 
	this_object()->query("name") and Now It Works. This is a mystery 
	but maybe Leto can explain it.  Moby 

Fri Nov 11 21:35:00 1994   paul   (Leto at 131.174.124.36)

	* Renamed status types to int in smartmosnter Renamed status type 
	to int type in smartmonster 

Thu Nov 10 14:25:00 1994   paul   (Leto at 131.174.124.71)

	* Applied same patch to monster.c as to user.c, not sure if its 
	okay 

Wed Nov  9 23:31:56 1994   paul   (Leto at 127.0.0.1)

	* Messed quite a bit with attack code in user.c (see comments 
	there) Added mudlib error handler functions. 

Mon Oct 24 16:31:33 1994   Leigh Blue Caldwell   (Blue at phdsa.tp.ph.ic.ac.uk)

	* /std/user.c: Changed the OWNER_ONLY permission on the no_attack 
	property to READ_ONLY so that the owner can still change it, but 
	now others can read too. 

Mon Oct 24 09:49:08 1994   Leigh Blue Caldwell   (Blue at phdsa.tp.ph.ic.ac.uk)

	* /std/user.c: Added in consistency_check() and create() a setting 
	of "no_attack" to 1 with security OWNER_ONLY. Conditional on 
	NO_PKILL being defined, and stops players attacking each other 
	unless they have deliberately set no_attack off. NO_PKILL is 
	currently defined in config.h (additional comments there and 
	/std/body/attack.c). 

Tue Aug 16 14:30:44 1994   Anthon Pang   (Robocoder at actlab.rtf.utexas.edu)

	* /std/user.c: moved LOGOUT_MSG to later in quit() 

Thu Aug 11 16:15:00 1994   Anthon Pang   (Robocoder at actlab.rtf.utexas.edu)

	* /std/user.c: undid Moby's change... test char "Ahab" didn't get 
	dumped either with the mod 

Thu Aug 11 15:22:00 1994   Steve Schmidt   (Mobydick at wisdom.Stanford.EDU)

	* Commented out line 726, which sets last_on, in user.c do to a 
	driver problem (so say Robocoder anyway) which caused net-deads 
	to not be dumped. It can be commented back in when the driver 
	gets fixed. 

Fri Jun 17 04:19:12 1994   John Viega   (Rust at darwin.clas.Virginia.EDU)

	* fixed user.c so that NO_LOGIN_PAUSE actually works if you turn 
	it on. 

Fri May 20 08:42:20 1994   George Reese   (Descartes at nightmare.connected.com)

	* Added define for TERMINAL_D to daemons.h 

Fri May 20 08:40:23 1994   George Reese   (Descartes at nightmare.connected.com)

	* Added lines to receive_message() to support colours using 
	Pinkfish's Discworld protocol. Also added the static private 
	globals __Term and __TermInfo 

Tue May 17 01:29:29 1994   GD Hack II   (Inspiral at mulberry.wustl.edu)

	* /std/connection.c: added create() { seteuid(0); } and added if( 
	geteuid( previous_object() ) != ROOT_UID ) return 0; to 
	restore()...should be a bit more secure, if not slower ;) 

Fri May 13 19:56:29 1994   GD Hack II   (Inspiral at mulberry.wustl.edu)

	* /std/connection.c: Made logon() check previous_object() == 
	this_object() for security reasons. This potentially closes 
	another security hole. 

Thu May 12 04:11:19 1994   Anthon Pang   (RoboCoder at mindlink.bc.ca)

	* /std/user.c: changed cap_name to MASTER_ONLY (will only apply to 
	new players); in the meantime, see CAP_NAME_MASTER_ONLY kludge 

Thu May 12 04:10:39 1994   Anthon Pang   (RoboCoder at mindlink.bc.ca)

	* /include/login_macros.h: added LINK_CAP_NAME 

Thu May 12 04:10:13 1994   Anthon Pang   (RoboCoder at mindlink.bc.ca)

	* /include/config.h: added CAP_NAME_MASTER_ONLY 

Tue May 10 03:53:23 1994   Anthon Pang   (Robocoder at mindlink.bc.ca)

	* /std/connection.c: temporary logging added to restore() to find 
	out which player object isn't being restore_object()'d properly 
	by 'finger' (see debug.log) 

Tue Apr 26 02:29:02 1994   Anthon Pang   (Robocoder at annex2.net.ubc.ca)

	* /std/server.c: a new standard object for special daemons, ie 
	servers, which can't inherit DAEMON because of the 
	self-destructing clean_up(). (that is, SERVER is an 
	alternative...eg flock) 

Mon Apr 25 05:22:11 1994   Anthon Pang   (Robocoder at annex1.net.ubc.ca)

	* /std/user.c, user/tsh.c, body/alias.c: more shadow protection 

Sun Apr  3 03:36:44 1994   Anthon Pang   (Robocoder at annex1.net.ubc.ca)

	* /std/user.c: alternative to QUIT_LOG message when a user 
	(disconnected) is swept from the system. 

Sat Mar 26 13:15:56 1994   Douglas Reay   (Pallando at pinatubo.ccs.neu.edu)

	* Added delete_access() to /std/priv.c 

Wed Mar  9 13:12:34 1994   Steve Schmidt   (Mobydick at wisdom.Stanford.EDU)

	* Patched a bug in user.c; ROOT_UID didn't have permissions to 
	cause a user to quit, and this caused the _su.c command to leave 
	disconnected bodies and connection objects behind. Patch was 
	just to allow ROOT_UID to call the function. 

Tue Feb  1 18:27:02 1994   John Viega   (Rust at 128.143.44.137)

	* Installed a modified room.c that will accept a filename as a key 
	for ob_data["objects"] and a number for the value, and will 
	clone the number of copies of the key specified by the value. 

Fri Dec 24 02:44:30 1993   Steve Schmidt   (Mobydick at wisdom.Stanford.EDU)


Altered shop.c to print "Two daggers" instead of "Dagger"  "Dagger" 
when two (or more) objects have the same short and same price. 

Fri Nov 12 12:54:23 1993   Steve Schmidt   (Mobydick at wisdom.Stanford.EDU)

	* Installed Rust's logind patches whiuch fix some bugs in WIZ_LOCK 
	(which doesn't get tested at TMI-2 real often for the obvious 
	reason. :) 

Sun Oct 31 16:29:03 1993   Steve Schmidt   (Mobydick at wisdom.Stanford.EDU)

	* Altered quit() so that it can only be called from this_object(). 
	This makes it impossible to force other people to quit other 
	than by the force_me. hook. I can't believe we didn't already 
	have security on it. :( 

Fri Sep 24 13:54:32 1993   Steve Schmidt   (Mobydick at wisdom.Stanford.EDU)

	* the combat code in monster.c has a fair number of write()s in 
	it. As long as combat is called from heart_beat, not a problem, 
	but if it is called with this_player() defined, someone sees a 
	message they should not. I changed two of them (the "you hit" 
	and "you miss") to tell_object but there are others. say well, 
	got it partly fixed say you just need to change some writes to 
	tell_object say it only duplicates when this_player() is 
	something, when in combat, it usually isn't. 

Thu Sep 23 03:26:56 1993   Steve Schmidt   (Mobydick at wisdom.Stanford.EDU)

	* Fixed a bad bug in the bank. Line 146 was doing: if 
	(something>number) instead of the correct version, if 
	(something>newnum) and the result was that if you had 0 platinum 
	but 100 gold, you could trick the bank into giving you 100 
	platinum and leave you with -900 gold (which of course you would 
	never pay back ;) I made this change. I also posted on the main 
	board, and to rgm.lp, so I think everyone will know about it 
	that needs to. 

Mon Sep 20 20:38:25 1993   Steve Schmidt   (Mobydick at wisdom.Stanford.EDU)

	* Fixed a typo in monster.c: was setting max_val, not max_vol, in 
	create. Not a big deal as that value is usually overriden by the 
	inheriting file. 

Mon Sep 20 20:37:17 1993   Steve Schmidt   (Mobydick at wisdom.Stanford.EDU)

	* fixed bank_card.c, which was setting weight, not mass and bulk.
