mesg "was real upset and stuff, sorry i didn't let ya know..but had to talk to him and get him calmed down.anyway.yeah, the drivers would be part of the low level, and should be written in native of course.especially the interface types.they need to be fast, responsive and dynamic.thats part of the AI..the interface needs to be flexable enough to also be manipulated by the user or the aidepending on the situation.for example lets say that the user always clicks on the edge of an iconwell, the ai would know that the user isn't clicking properly so would enlarge them automatically in order to help out the user see where he she needs to  clickthings like thatagain i am sorry about the disappearance."
