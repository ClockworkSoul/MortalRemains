This is a large rectangularly shaped room.  In one corner stands an
angular wrought iron staircase spiraling its way through the ceiling.
In the northwest corner sits a comfortable looking armchair covered in
a rich burgundy crushed velvet.  Along side a chair is a simple iron
and glass endtable.  The only other furniture in the room is a large
metal worktable with a thick glass surface.
