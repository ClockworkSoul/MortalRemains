mesg "well, i finally did it, got that other slot i need to make 2so i took sig spell...i was just wondering whatthe parameters were for sig spell so i could think of somethingvaguely reasonable :-)For bare ideas i've been batting around a magic immunity (oreven a spell turning) or perhaps something like the Wall of ASHfrom DK Sourcebook, kinda acting like a really pumped fireshieldbut with a much shorter duration.What would be kinda neat on the other hand would be a shimeringbolt of energy, call it the Golden Bolt of Power, having it doenergy, fire, and impact damage.  either do really mack damageor do pretty good damage and then something else (like stun,chance of insta, etc.)just some ideas :-)-Marcus"
