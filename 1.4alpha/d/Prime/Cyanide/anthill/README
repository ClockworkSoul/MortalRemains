This entire area was coded with Chronos's Maze Maker utility!
Amazingly enough, I only had to tweak the area slightly to make it
usable.  I remove 2 exits to prevent little loops that would have been
stupid, and I added a few more monsters to make the area worth coming to.

This is the first successful test of the Maze Maker. :D
