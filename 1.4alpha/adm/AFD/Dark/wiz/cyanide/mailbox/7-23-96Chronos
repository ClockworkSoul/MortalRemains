Subject: put..
==================================
I've been working on the put, get, give, drop and all that commands..
object movement crap.. I just wanted to find out if you could make 
"put all in corpse"
"put all coins in corpse"
"put all sword in corpse" 
etc.
.. Make them work.  Like.. using drop as a guideline or whatever.
If you don't feel like it or if you have something else to do, lemme know
and I'll do it.  ;)
