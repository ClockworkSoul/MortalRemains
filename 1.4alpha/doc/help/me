If you typed this, you probably fall into one of three groups:

    1 - You are an utter newbie: If this is the case, you may wish to try
        'help help' or 'help commands'.

    2 - You have been traped by a bug: If this is the case, you may use 
        the 'wizcall' command. Please note you may ONLY use this command 
        in emergencies.
    
    3 - You are goofing around: If this is the case, you may be beyond 
        help.
