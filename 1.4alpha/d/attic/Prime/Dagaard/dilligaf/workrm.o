In fact there are even some Rap albums near a  stereo to place anguish on all who listen. This is truly the room  of pain. Off to one side is a sign.","long":"@@query_long","light":1,"id":({"beer",}),"exits":(["vikings":"/u/d/dilligaf/Vikings/area/ice1.c","oblivion":"/u/d/dilligaf/cellar.c","start":"/d/Ancients/rooms/wizrm","city":"/u/d/dilligaf/street/street1.c",]),"capacity":9938032,])
