A player's class is essentially his or her profession and life
calling, therefore cannot be easily abandoned. 

The player's skills, level, titles, and abilities are all greatly
affected by the player's chosen class, so choose wisely, for you
will not get another chance with the same player.

For information on currently offered classes and the directions
to their respective class halls, ask Alucard at the Intersection.
