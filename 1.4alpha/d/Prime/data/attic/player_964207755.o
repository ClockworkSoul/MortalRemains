I came to a single conclusion.  There's a SERIOUS problem withsome of our classes.  My current focus is on the Sharpshooters.. Theyare hurting for some powers.. So I'm gonna be making some pretty intensechanges with them.  Any suggestions can be mailed directly to me forconsideration.  ;)Here are the changes I've made to the Sharpshooters to help them out.1) The scan command now actually does something useful.  I will make it   even more usefull in the near future, because the new lore command   kinda take away from it.  :)2) The breech command has been rewritten from scratch, the previous   version.. Has been sacked.  My apologies.  This is how the new   breech power works..Power: BreechCost: All of your HP.  Caster must be at MAX HP to use this power.Duration: Permanent effect, until weapon is unwielded.Effect: Caster imbues weapon with his/her own life force, adding magical   bonuses to the weapon currently wielded.
