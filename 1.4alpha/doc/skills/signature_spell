Signature Spell   (Wizard, Priest skill)
Required Level: 20

The Signature Spell skill allows the mage or priest to request
of administration that a specific spell be coded, as described
by the player. The details of the spell must be agreed upon by
the administration and the player.

From then on, the player's signature spell will be available only
to that player, and no others, unless he or she is nuked or 
otherwise destroyed.
