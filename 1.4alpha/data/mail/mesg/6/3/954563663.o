mesg "hey dude, i lost all my autolods again a few weeks ago.  I've kindabeen hanging out whenever i had time to get online just waiting for uor another whiz to help me out.  I was able to get everything back on myown except my spell talisman.  val and shya are on now and they played hellgetting that back for me.  In fact, they overdid it, ive got 3 of em now,and they dont know how to dest the extras.So ..... Could you PLEASE (this will be like the second time ive asked for this i beleive)make an easy way for people to get back thier autoloads!.  ATY least train yer whizz'son how to do it for us.  I mean all it should take is a simple post on the whizboard, then just tell me what note number it is, and when i see a whiz onlinei can tell em to read that note and fix me up.  Dont forget to tell them howto dest xtra autoloading non droppable objects.Second, for the record, I think the way this happened was that my pet attackedme AGAIN!!!! (did i tell u this already?)  I think i accidentally commanded it to protect the monster i was killing.  Anyway, i tried to run, and of course he followedme, by the time i remembered that the only way to escape was to quit, it was toolate, right as i typed quit, he kilt me.  I saw the quit messages, ya know 'is lifeto good for mudding' or whatever, but then right b4 the disconnect message, i got theYou Die message.-hoss (put those mid terms off a few weeks and get to work here!)"
