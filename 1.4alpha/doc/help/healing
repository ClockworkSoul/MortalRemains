Healing can occur in several ways:

1 - If the player allows time to pass, he or she will heal every 20 
    seconds. The exact amount of healing depends on several factors,
    including his level, constitution score, and maximum hit point level.

2 - The player may purchase alcoholic beverages at the pub, which add hit
    points immediately, as well as making the character drunk. Drunk 
    characters are less effective in combat, but heal at a slightly faster
    rate.

3 - Many pristly spells have the ability to heal a character.
