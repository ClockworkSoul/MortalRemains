Goblins are small humanoids standing about four feet tall, with long arms,
bandy legs, and harsh mannerisms. A goblin's face is broad and flat, with
a wide fang-filled mouth, pointed ears, and an olive or dull yellow 
coloration. Goblins are generally savege, cowardly, opportunistic, and
untrustworthy.

Due to his inferior size and questionable reputation, a goblin suffers a 
-1 to his Strength and Charisma scores.
