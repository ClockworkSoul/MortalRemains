mesg "Hi Cy;Dalceon was testing a new toy he made, and his wiz char got trapped. He can't do anything. He loged his player char to ask me for help. I made the mistake of cloning his malfunctioning toy, and my wiz char got trapped too. I can't use it now. It's locked or something. Is there something you can do to help us?Desperately seeking for help;Dalceon and Nsd"
