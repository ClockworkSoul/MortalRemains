mesg "ok not sure how to word this because i don't even know if there has been a miscommunication or not...however, on the chance that there has i'm trying to clear it up:)i made an assumption..that if and when you wanted to know about my life you would ask. in a conversation a few days ago...(about how guys and gals think differently) it occurs to me that you may have instead made an assumption also.  when i said i have been alone for a year in one of our conversations i meant in the bedroom but i am not divorced yet. it is in the works and has been for over a year and we have separate bedrooms but for financial reasons i still share the house with him. anyway i just wanted to tell you so that you so you would know the situation and not feel later that i had not been truthful with you. and if you're wondering why i did this mud mail it was so i would have a quiet minute to make sure i said what i meant to say. i think you are someone special and i care what you think so i hope that if there was a miscommunication that you are ok with this. take caremhairi"
