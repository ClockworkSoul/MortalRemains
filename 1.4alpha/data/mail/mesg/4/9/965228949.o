I'll give     you full lord status within the next couple of weeks.2 - You want him, he's all yours.  :)  Any ideas he has he discusses    with you. Your area is all your decisions. One of the reasons    I promote few people to Lord status is that I have to trust    them to make decisions like these.3 - SOmething I wanted to discuss with you: (unrelated topic). I'm    not sure if I asked you about this yet, but I'm asking all the    lords to write up a short proposal regarding their areas. In    in would be stuff like what areas would be contained within the    domain, what kind of stuff you owuld like to do, what kind of    directions, and all that jazz. Of course, you wouldn't be     required to stick to the letter of it, but I would just like     an idea of the kind of indeas you have for your domain.Thanks, hon.  :)As soon as I see Nemar (or Chronos does) one of us will go ahead andadd him to Ocean.  What kind of projects is he working on now?Anything he can convert to Ocean or finish quickly?-Cy-Sleep: A completely inadequate substitute for caffeine."
