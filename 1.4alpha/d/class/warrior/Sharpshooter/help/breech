This ability enables a Sharpshooter to focus his
energies and imbue a wielded weapon with his
lifeforce.  The resulting effect is that the weapon
will receive a +1 magical bonus for every 10
levels the player has advanced, with +4 being the
maximum available bonus.  The weapon will
glow brightly from this enchantment and will
provide light for the wielder as long as the
enchantment is active.  The effect ends as soon
as the weapon leaves the user's hands, thus
breaking the bond.

You may only use this ability if you are at your
maximum hit points, and you will be left with
one hit point.
