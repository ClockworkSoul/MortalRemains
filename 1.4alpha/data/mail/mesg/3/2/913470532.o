mesg "Hey, look at the spells in ~chronos/jester/spells ..Specifically, check out:illusion.cfog.cjuxtaposition.cfumble.cdragon_breath.cI KNOW Juxtaposition isn't a real D&D spell, but it'd make a fun quest forplayers, wouldn't it?Need to add savings throws to some of that stuff, but other than thatthe spells are done. ie - Feel free to add them to your huge spell directory if you want.And modify them as you wish. :D"
