mesg "I havetwo things tosay, and I hope they do not take up much of your time.1. PLEASE do not poen my area unless you decide to make me a wiz againDarkangel said he was goingto open it, and I respectfully request that he not.2. I have an idea for my area.Since you do not feel that it belongs in Inner, I have a suggestion:Move it to outer.This is the premise for the area.The lord of Pandemonium decided to have a little fun and create his own sub-plane of the Pandemonium zone.It isn't part of Pandemonium itself, but the Lord of Pandemonium created it.Anyway, it is like his home, like a private estate.The four master elmenetals are like his close associates.You have to kill each one befpore you can enter, his room that is in the firstroom of the area(the onewith all the windows.)What do you guys think?This idea is only in it's infancy right now, and i don't even know if you will letme implement it.But Please don't open my area unless you make me a wiz again!I beg youVery humble,-Wiggin/Kyako"
