==================================
Idea!  


Steps to approval - 

Balance Team - Approval Team - Administration.

In no particular order, with admins having the final say in 
everything.  Period.  

Balance would handle all power/cost/balance - related crap.

Approval would handle all the code/consistency/quality control, etc

Admins would provide final decisions in disputes, assist in QC,
  consistency, coding, balance, everything, basically, and interfere
  as we see fit.

Sound good ?  A triumvirate of sorts.
*smirk*

-Chronos.. As far from democracy as one can get.
