Another example of a hybrid, half-orcs are products of human and orc 
parents. Of a height similar to half-elves, half-orcs usually resemble
their human parent enough to pass for a human in public. Their skin ranges
from peach to olive to deep tan, and their hair can be blond, red, brown,
black, gray, and any shade in between.

From their orcish parent, half-orcs have a +1 bonus to their initial
Strength and Constitution scores, and a -2 Charisma.
