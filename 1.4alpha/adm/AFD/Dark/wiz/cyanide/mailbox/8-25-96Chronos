Subject: Your domains.
==================================
Domain directory structures -
They must be organized somehow, and it's completely up to your
discretion/mood/etc.  

Regulating code -
You have say over whether things belong in your area or not.
Admins have the power to overrule you at any time, as they see
fit, and Chronos (yours truly) is the final decision in all disputes.
You are to make sure all areas in your domain are coded portably.
Everything in your domain is still subject to the Balance Team
and the Approval Team.  Your main job is organizing wizards and
directing the area as a whole.  You are also to be a source of
support and help to the wizards who need it.

I'd like to see every domain have a domain board room or whatever
where public discussion can take place.  I'd like to connect
each of these rooms to the main wizhall guild room so people can
go see what is going on in each domain if they are interested 
in them, and might wanna join.

Finally, it is your responsibility as a domain lord to be
available.  You need to be around, basically.  You are also expected
to keep people coding and motivated, and happy.  

I will probably be putting the more finalized rules/laws/boundaries/
or whatever you wanna call them into /doc/Law, so make sure you
check it in a few weeks.

Any questions, comments, etc .. ?
