This is the middle part of a formal garden. Hedges hide the
cavern walls and a dim illumination comes from above. The path
is of small crushed white stones. It winds among bushes and
flower beds from south to north. To the north a small structure
can be seen. To the south are peculiarly shaped bushes.
There is a gap in the hedges to the west.
