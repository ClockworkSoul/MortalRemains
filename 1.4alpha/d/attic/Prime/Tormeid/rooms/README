draw1.c is the entrance to the area.

Each floor of the castle is a 17 x 17 grid, with the outermost rooms being
the castle wall.  This means there are as many as 289 rooms on the top floor
and as many as 256+ room on the first floor.
This makes a grand total of ... as many as 550 rooms in this joint.
HOLY Shit.
Quite an undertaking.

oh yeah.. did I mention the dungeon?

Oh yeah.. some of the rampart files are missing.  ie - Rampart41.c and 
  rampart25.c .. and some others.  No big deal, I accidentally made too
  many and later fixed it.  Oh well, the players will never see the boo-boos.

Ahh.  There's a shop and a pub here now, in the commoner section.
