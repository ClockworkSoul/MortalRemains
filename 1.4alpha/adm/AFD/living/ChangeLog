	* /std/living/edit.c: added check to handle case where the tmp 
	editor file is rm'd...so editing aborts without an error 

Tue Nov  2 01:08:16 1993   Steve Schmidt   (Mobydick at wisdom.Stanford.EDU)

	* Altered env.c, so that environment variables can only be set if 
	this_player() has the same euid as this_object(). Prevents 
	people from setting env vars in other people. Which is not good. 
	:(

	* Made a patch to _mailreg.c to show the names of mail registered 
	characters correctly. Karathan's work, and mighty fine at that.

	* Moved edit.old to /std/attic 

Mon Jun 28 21:36:44 1993   Luke Mewburn   (Zak at 131.170.8.11)

	* improved env.c... added env_exists(var), and changed all 
	set_env/query_env/remove_env/etc to use it.
