mesg ";)  You're gonna love this shit.If you think there is an invisible player in the room with you,cast glitter.  You're gonna love it.Also, ALWAYS have a stoneskin cast upon you. If you didn't have itbefore, you do now. Also, you now have \"colorspray\", which is justkinda neat.-Cy  BTW - Stoneskin costs 1000 gold to cast. Worth it."
