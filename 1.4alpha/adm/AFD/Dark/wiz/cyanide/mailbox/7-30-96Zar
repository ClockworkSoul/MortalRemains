==================================
Hi there!

I am a friend of Chronos' and Waxer's.  They told me to email you
about joining the team.  I have some coding experience, and some (what
I think are) cool ideas for areas, mosnters, objects, etc.
Don't know what else to say, so I'll say "adios" for now!

See Ya!
