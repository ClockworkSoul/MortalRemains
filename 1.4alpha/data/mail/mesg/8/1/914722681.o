mesg "How do I remove all of a person's clothing and eq when I teleport them into a room?For instance in my jailcell, you pull the lever and it sends you into another roomwhere you are stripped of all of your clothes and left nekked.How do I do that? Using a gate command might work, but it has to disern what the personis wearing too, is there a drop all command that I can use? Just curious,working on the area and it should be done (hopefully) before the next semester begins.-- Dilli"
