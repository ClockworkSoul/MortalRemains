newbie (n.) - A player on a MUD who is of low level, or with little playing
              experience.  See also: rookie, greenie, amateur.

If you just started, you are a newbie.  Until you gain a few levels, you 
will be a newbie.  We've all been there before.

As a newbie, you will be extremely vulnerable and weak.  You need to develop
your skills and gain experience and levels to become more powerful.  You 
will choose a class (aka profession) at a guildhall, and you will gather
equipment to help aid you in combat.  You will fight things- You may die.
An adventurer's life is never easy.

The first thing you need to do is ask for some help from the fellow in the
center of town.  He will give you some equipment, a map, and a leaflet
to aid you in getting started.  The leaflet in particular will be useful
to you in your early days.  It will explain much about mudding, and this
MUD in particular.  Simple type "exa leaflet" to look at it once it's given
to you.

And remember, if you need even more help, ask around. :)
