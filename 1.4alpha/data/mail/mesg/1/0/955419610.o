mesg "Hey Cy, Bomber,beetlejuice,merlin,dreamscape here,  *grin*Just a quick question,	There was no one on today, and I wanted to try and get some equipment for myself. I was going to try and sell it, but certiain pieces ofequipment are not being re-sold by the shop (they are too valuable maybe)Anyway, So what I did was drop the rest in the mage guild hall. I then loggedout and was going to log back in as another player, There was no one elseon as far as players, aor I would have given the euqip to a player to holdbut when I loged in as my other character the pile of equipment was gone.I dont know if that was because of a wiz destructing it or something that hasto do with the game. I'm also not sure if this is incriminating evidence or not, but I wanted to check because at the time I had no other options.Thanks,B,B,M,D"
