By Cyanide, June 24th - 1997###
You find yourself wandering outside of your body.  You look down and
see your dead body.  You immediately think, "This bites ass."
###
You find it hard to resist floating up... up... up.
###
You float to the top of what appears to be a mountain.  There, standing
all alone, is a man dressed in a long black cloak and robes, wielding
a glowing sickle.
###
Death says [to you]: State your business here!  Oh.. heh.  My bad, you're
dead ain't ya.
###
Death looks at some papers.  Death looks at you.
###
Death says [to you]: You mortals make me sick; always dying and shit.
Death says [to you]: How fucking hard is it to stay alive????!!!
###
Death says: Bah, fuck the paper work, I am just gonna remove you.
###
Death grabs you by the back of the head.
###
Death peers into your eyes.
Death says [to you]: You mortals give me tension.
###
Death says: I think I am growing a tumor.
###
Death opens a hatch marked "ASSHOLE".
Death says: This is where I'm going to put you.
Death says: This is where I keep all the real troublemakers.
###
The darkness seems to take form as Cyanide appears before your eyes.
###
Cyanide looks at you.
###
Cyanide sneers at Death.
###
Death says [to Cyanide]: Fuck you, Cyanide.  This one is mine.
Death says: After I get done with the mortal, you are next.
###
Cyanide says: Do you doubt my power, Death?
###
Death looks at you.
Death looks down.
###
Death makes a quick swipe at Cyanide with his scythe.
###
Cyanide's head is removed from his body.
###
Death throws his head back and cackles with glee.
Death says [to you]: Now.. It's your turn.
###
The body of Cyanide casually walks over to its head and picks it up.
Cyanide raises his head to his shoulders and reattaches it.
###
Cyanide calls forth a pure white beam of energy.
###
Death shrieks in pain.
Death falls to the ground and disappears.
###
Cyanide says: He'll be back soon.  You had better leave now.
Cyanide slowly vanishes into the darkness.
###
You hear a cackle come from the shadows, and run down the mountain.
