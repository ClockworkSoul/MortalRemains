mesg "I knew i was going to have to go through this again, i wish i wouldaprinted up the last one and saved it.600 aint that much damage when u consider a few things.1.  as you said, its fire and crushing, many things are immune to one or theother of those damages2.  its avg 600 points once every, what 5 rounds?  I can do about 100 pointsa round with 2 pretty good weapons, that averages out to like 200/round if i use it every time i can, which i dotn because its so expensive.3.  i dont know anyhting about sharpshooters, but fighters can do what 400 per round?they do at least 300, and im pretty sure they average closer to 500 with allof thier multi attacks.  The point is, thats every round, without using spellpoints.4.  Mages SHOULD be way more powerful than fighters at high levles.  Thats the wholedeal, mages are fucking hard to play at low levels, the payoff is supposed to be thatwe are the mackest at higher levels, thats not the way it is, unless you make my sigspell do a min of 1k damage.  Fighters, and sharpshooters are totally fuckin easyat low levels compared to mages.  Not to mention the fact that we need so much morexp to level than anyone else.  I mean, if we're not going to be more powerful, thenhow about changing up the xp so that i have enough xp to be about lvl 45.  With the work i've done on this fucking char, thats where i would be as a fighter.  -lata man, dont think im getting bitchy, its just im tired of going through thisargument, and i dont think you've ever really even disagreed with me, i mean i maybe off on those numbers, but not by much, and you know it.-hoss"
