==================================
Waxer told me you needed some areas coded, and to mail you... well, here's my mail ;)

I've coded areas on a few different muds, but none of them have gone public yet, mostly due to admin problems, hopefully i'll be able to get some real work done here, and be able to see players actually in my areas :)
