In my experience,when employers do referance checks, they have a standardchecklist of questions, and don't care id its business or personal.(I should know.. I do them everyday.  ;)Even if they do, it prolly won't be for a while. A few weeks,perhaps.> > > DanaJust to let you know, it's unlikely you'll ever be called ona referance check...   but I REALLY appreciate you helping meout this way.-C"
