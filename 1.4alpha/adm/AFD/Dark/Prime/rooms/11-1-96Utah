==================================
Hi there :)

My contributions to the Light domain are:

1. A newbie area ... a sandcastle in which newbies can kill sandfleas and
   jellyfish, etc. ... the monsters are coded ... rooms won't take long, as 
   it won't be a large area (estimated 20 rooms at most).

2. Nightmask had asked me to code the town but I haven't done much in that
   regard. I will code the town still if you want me to but I want to start
   it from scratch rather than redoing Nm's code. Let me know so I can move
   quicker on it :)

Thanks,
     u
