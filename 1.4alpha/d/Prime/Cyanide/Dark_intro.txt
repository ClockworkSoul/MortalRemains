Alright, Here's what I have so far as the history of the City of Urborg,
a.k.a "Dark Area"...   ;)

Long ago, the City of Urborg was a peaceful and prosperous dwarven city,
both ancient and beautiful. Over the millenia, the dwarves of Urborg
grew rich, and meny beings of many races grew jealous of the dwarven
wealth, and lusted after having it as their own.
     During this period, the so-called "Golden Age" of the dawrves of
the realm, a new leader rose, and the people loved him. They built
statues of this king, and dedicated temples to his name.
     Then the Conquerer (his name so far) came. With his unholy minions
and a thirt for conquest, the Conquerer attacked Urborg and its
dwarf-king. The fierce battle raged for days. The dwarf-king was blessed
with the divinity of his god. The Conquerer was aided by his own Unholy
liege as well, but he also wielded great black sorceries. (See the tie-in
with black magic?) In the end, The Conquerer claimed victory, slew the
dwarf-king, and proclaimed himself Lim-Dul, sorcerer-king of Urborg.
     Torkath the Divine (name so far), Dwarf-king of Urborg, Slayer of
Orcs, Ravager of trolls, lay dead. buried beneath the rubble of his own
palace, killed by the black sorceries of Lim-Dul and his apprentices. The
carnage did not end with Torkath's death, however. Thylassa - "The Iron
Maiden", Kormus the Bleak Artificer, Tallon the Souless, Lim-Dul the
Conquerer, and others continued to hurl destructive spells into the city.
The citizens of Urborg could only scream in terror, beg for mercy,
flee... and eventually die.
     The Iron Maiden rained fire on Torkath's warrior-priests, the
Ember-eyed caused the earth to shake and split asunder. Tallon sent
lightning hurtling down every street.
     Then the seven made ruins of the city their home, with the
tortured undead citizens of Urborg as their servants.
