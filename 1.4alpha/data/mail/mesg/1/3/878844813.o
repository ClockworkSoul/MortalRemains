mesg "Actually, I was just finishing up \"invisibility\" and \"glitterdust\".  Also, I'll soon put a boardroom in the wizard's guild, that onlymages can get into.   ;)I've done a bunch of high-level spells lately, too.  They ROCK.You'll get to see them soon enough.,, shit like \"haste\" (the onlyplayer that'll get THAT spell will be you, duder) and \"meteor swarm\".Meteor swarm does over 100 points of damage in a hit on the average.NICE SPELL.PLUS - I just got protector code working, so SUMMONING MONSTERS willbe in any day now!I got the spell itch.   ;)-Cy"
