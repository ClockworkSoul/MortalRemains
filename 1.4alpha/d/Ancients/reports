have a 'new' command for boards.  'new' being type 'new' and your next new note opens.  This is a MUST for boards because without it and if there are alot of notes.  it sux and isnt worth even trying.  you dont even have a 'last <#>'  such as 'last 12'   

just my ideas.  even though probably ahead of where you are.
