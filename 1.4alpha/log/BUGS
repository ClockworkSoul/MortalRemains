the next time i wear them it says ring1 is nto a valid type
Its also said it for cloaks, like i think the homeless mans
rags.  It alsmost seems like when i try to wear those items
their armour type changes.  It happens every time with the rings from

heartstone doesn't seem to be working quite like the spellcraft
says.  Theres 2 things ive noticed so far.  

#1.  I do not see any forms of healing that don't work.  course the only
ways i know to check are drinking, and slow healing (including using trollish).

cb
#2.  Spellcraft says that heartstone will protect me from slashing and well whatever
it says, it should also be protecting me from wounding damage.  When i kill barbazu
or cornugons with heartstone, i do not take any damage from them but still wind
up with bleeding wounds that i have to quit in order to get rid of.

also, not sure if this is a bug, but i noticed the decatur copbots can hit me despite
the heartstone, but cannot hit through stoneskin, that doesnt make a lot of sense,
what kind of damage do they do with those batons anyway?

i hope u got all that.

kinda wierd, i was trying out that new gun ...from what i could tell, when i
attacked killer, my foresight spell fired off twice, then i started hitting
killer and he couldnt hit back.  I'll test some more to see if this is a reproducable
bug with foresight.

cause lemme tell you, if it is, i feel tiamat may not be longed for this world!

Hoss at Sat Mar  4 04:51:31 2000 in /d/Planar/Baator/minauros/city15
ok, did more research on the bug from earlier.

it appears to be from foresight.

if i have foresight active and attack anything, foresight tries to fire off twice
and the monster cant hit me, while i am able to attack him. 

If I cast a spell on him, he will start to attack me again.
I think fi i command my pet to attack, he will attack the pet and when hes done
with the pet he will attack me.

also, if i leave the room and come back, he doesnt attack me.

dude, im dyin here, i wanna abuse this soooo bad and kill tiamat.  But, i know 
thats uncool, its not how i do business.  Here's how i do bidness, ive 
reported this bug .... now all i got to do is wait for u to log on at least once
then i can use the hell outta it till u get it fixed.

Hoss at Sat Mar  4 04:59:57 2000 in /d/Planar/Baator/minauros/city15
for the record .. heres how i think foresight should work, this should
fix the aforementioned bug.  I think it should only fire off
when you are attacked.  Its kinda lame the way it works now.  I mean think aboiut it,
its supposed to be a protection from pk, and if i was going to pk someone, id prolly
wait till they were killing a monster or right after they wimpied from one.  In
that instance, foresight wouldnt do ya a dam bit of good.  It would even be allright
if it only fired off in pk, so the shadow warriors autoing me when i walk in wouldnt
set it off.


ok lesse now, i need 3 mil to level ... tiamat is worth 200k ... so id need to kill
her 15 times.  Holy geez thats gunna take forever with no spells.  I bet my
weapons wont even hit her, but rest assured i will find a way.  

Oh scuze me, my mind was wandering, ignore that last part

see it more as a 'work around' than anything else, so this is more of an FYI
but anyway, i can get to the sanctuary with the ancient gold ring even from

Personally, i think u should just leave this, soince there are only 3 charges
in the ring and its not really all that east to get, and in fact im pretty sure
im the only one who even knows where it is, and i dont tell people where

Certain pets are supposedly immune to poison, however they are still dying from
poison atacks... The rampager's use acid and others use poison, but the
amnizu's are listed as being immune to poison yet they are still dying from 
poison attacks...

I get a message quite often in combat that says 'you hit criticlally' or
something like that. I would think that this would mean I do the maximum amount
of dammage for that particular attack. However, according to the dammage message I recieve for the very next line
I am NOT getting the max dammage message of KNOCKS THE SHIT blah...

Any thoughts<?

I feel that very powerfull things like Dispater's staff for example should not
be sold at the shop, but instead 'hide the valuable item away
 or something...

Just my 2 cents. Yes i know this should have been an 'Idea' but i hit
the wrong dam report. so sue me....

Spell talismans - it seems that when you leave a the mud, you lose stored

When you have your limit of followers (pets) and cast summon again it drains
the spell pionts and you get some kind of mud error:

You begin casting Monster Summoning VIII...
You cannot have any more followers at this time.

The cats that auto wont die. They will however keep killing you and i have
died twice because of it. Not too happy about the deaths. and Im thinking that
there is a bigger bug at work here than just in this area.

Thanks

Players and wizzes shouldn't be allowed to dammage/take dammage from each other
this is, in my opinion, a rather large bug.  I was testing it out last night
and I actualy was hurting and almost killing a wizard, who at this time will
remain nameless, as the point here is just to identify a problem not incriminate
others.

using the thief skill ventriloquism. I think that the semote list should be

if you set up an alias to kill the dealer by running in and out, and use it a few times then when you walk into the room, you willl start beating the crap out of him and he won't fight back. its a one sided fight... a bit easy to kill him that way.

When I tried to wear a shield, it said I couldn't due to having two weapons.  I unwielded my one weapon and then wore it and rewielded the blade and it allowed it.

pets are fucked up.  I cant make them invisibile anymore (that might be
a fuckup with invisible though)  And I cannot make my frostguard equip the shield 
cb

he was cloned with, and he will not drop it so i can check it out, AND he will
not drop his axe either.

Ok, it appears that the hide and backstab commands under thelp does not work.  When you type backstab, it gives the '
You're not hidden...  that target will see you coming!' message and when you hide, it does say you hide but you can not backstab as it gives you the same message.   According to the thelp, a thief can hide and backstab both at level 1.
