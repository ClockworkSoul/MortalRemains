mesg "How to make secret exits:As you may know, a normal exit looks like this:		      Obvious exits are: north and eastAnd they're coded like this:                     set(\"exits\", ([            \"north\" : \"/u/m/mrdarque/blah_room.c\",            \"east\" : \"/u/m/mrdarque/blah_room2.c\",             ]) );A secret exit is coded the same way we code the add_actions thing.I'll type here an example of a secret exit:          This is the room of Spooner. We all know he flirts as hell,          so don't get surprised if you find some kinky toys and           inflatable dolls somewhere. Here you can find a bed, a big          bed. There's a lot of beer cans dropped on the floor...          What a mess!                      There are no obvious exits.exa cansNothing but empty beer cans...exa bedA big bed. Seems like you can look under it...look under bedYou expect to find some porno magazines here, but instead you find a door.Seems like you can open it...open doorYou open the door. Suddenly you find yourself somewhere else...You're no longer where you were...*The string that reads 'open door' is the secret exit. Now lets see how it'scoded. Remember the add_action lesson?  We'll use that one here. it goes likethis: void init() { add_action(\"look_under_bed\", \"look\"); add_action(\"open_door\", \"open\"); } *we'll skip the look_under_bed to go straight to the secret exit, which is:open_door  int open_door(string str) {  write(  wrap(    You open the door. Suddenly you find yourself somewhere else...[D[D[D[D[D[D[D[D[D[D[D[D[D[D[D[D[D[D[D[D[D[D[D[D[D[D[D[D[D[D[D[D[D[D[D[D[D[D[D[D[D[D[D[D[D[D[D[D[D[D[D[D[D[D[D[D[D[D[D[D[D[D[D[D\"You open the door.

' The first one is whatthe friend of the player sees when the player opens the door. The second oneis what someone that already opened the door sees when someone else enter to that room. I used Spooner in the example because he's my pal, and I know a lot of him. I'll ask you to keep discretion about this example. Alwaysremember not to exceed the 70 chars per line, and ALWAYS end each line withan \\n\"); or \\n\"+  or \"+  depending on the case. I think I already taught youthe function of each one of those. I hope you're doing a nice area already.If not, I'll tell Cyanide myself. Remember you're wizing here because I askedCy to rewiz you. Don't lose that chance for stupidity, ok?  ;-PIf you finish your area, and get promoted, then I'll teach you the cool stuff.THE TOYS!!!  *grins like the evil fuck she is*"
