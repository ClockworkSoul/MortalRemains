Each class advances slots at a different rate.Here's the stats, cause they probably won't be printed again:WP = Weapon proficience slotsNWP = Non-weapon slotsWarriors (including fighters) - WP = 4 at 1st, plus 1 / 3 lvls.          NWP = 3 + 1/3 levels.Wizards WP = 1 + 1/6        NWP = 4 + 1/3Priests WP = 2+1/4        NWP = 4 + 1/3Rogues WP = 2 + 1/4       NWP = 3 + 1/4Also, there is a bonus number of slots based upon intelligence at 1st  level.-Cy","id":44,]),(["id":45,"body":"get all from corpse has a bug in it.","time":876432946,"poster":"Woobie","title":"< no title >",]),(["title":"Corpse","poster":"Cyanide","time":876619606,"body":"What kind of bug?-C","id":46,]),(["title":"heartbeat","poster":"Draconis","time":876632850,"body":"I not sure if it just me or something wrong with the system or what, but I was testing a weapon on the test dummy and when Iconnected for damage I got some array outta bounds things andthen no heartbeat.
