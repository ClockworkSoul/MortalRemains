I have been reading all through your documentation.  Unfortunately
Some of it points to a creation.c file supposably located in
/adm/obj..

Any idea of what happened to it would surely be of help.  I'm trying

documented systems.  I would like to look at the stat structure,

the poison usually takes a lot of hp, so this would be useful.

I dont have a card, I get a new card by open account and it says

coz I havent been keeping track of how much I have been putting in it
but it seems large, maybe I just rich and dont remember it. *grin*

I think there should be a cheapshot command in which in battle

i don't think it works on all mobs
but on some mobs
you can use a "do" sequence (or a fast alias i would assume...
i'm using telnet as my client so i don't have aliases or triggers)
to run in, spell amob, and run out without taking dmg.

this is more of a question.  and im not sure if its still true,
but im willing to bet it is, and ive always meant to ask about
it.  Why do you need a target to cast an area attack?  it doesn't
matter who u cast it at yer gunna hit everyone in the room,
so why require a target?  There were times when i knew a thief
was hidden in a room but i couldnt hit him with a fireball
unless someone else walked in and i casted the fireball at

trollish really should speed up yer healing rate 
rather than just helaing you more hps per
tick.

In ADnD didnt trolls like regen every round or something?
it wasnt a huge heal but it ahppeend fast


Idea : Hoss at Fri Sep 17 02:34:13 1999 in /d/Prime/Central/room/road0_-4
you should have some kevlar as armour on here.
ca
kevlar vests would be the obvious thing, and they
rock, but since a mage cant use them dont stop there
there are also kevlar entry vests which are designed
to be worn over yer normal vest and all yer clothes and 
thats what cops wear when they're going on raids.  Awesome
protection.  Those would fall more into a cloak category
though.  BTW, if youve never worn a bullet proof vest b4, 
lemme tell you, u feel like fuckin superman in it.  And
its even better with an entry vest over the top.  I let
ce

people whale away on me with one on and i never felt a thing,
and u dont lose any mobility with them either, other than
the fact that they are so dam heavy.  obviously the
disadvantage si they only cover yer chest, thats why you
could make some kevlar gloves, boots (i know those dont really
cb
exist but this is make beleive anyway) and also we need some
bullet-proof helmets, they actually make these, riot helmets,
there not REALLY bullet proof, but they are bullet resistant,
as long as the bullet doesnt hit straight on, the helmets will
deflect them.  

Anyway, just an idea, in case u ever read these logs.

Oh yeah, i was also thinking that if u had a kevlar
vest on, it would give u protection from prokectiles,
like u only take 1/2 damage, and the damage would be bludgening
instead of whatever kind of damage bullets do.  2 limitations
of kevlar vests along this vein, .22 rimfires are notorious
for being able to penetrate vests (even vests rated to
stop .44 mags at point blank range).  This has to do
with thier small diameter and low velocity, they just
bore right through the fibers.  Also, kevlar vests
do not even slow down edged weapons like knives.  Well
i guess they do slow down slashes, but not stabs.  Again
cs
the whole small diameter/low velocity thing i think.  
Not real sure on the physics there.  

1more thing, bullet proof vests also all have a shock
plate that is removeable.  Maybe you could code a
lil quest where we could find a shock plate for our
vest.  Normally these shock plates will lessen
the bludgenoning damage the wearer feels (usually
when ya get shot in the vest, the bullet wont touch you
but the force of the bullet can knock the wind out of ya
and break ribs etc...)  The shock plates are also able
to withstand rifleshots, most primary vests cannot do
this without a shock plate in.  However, most entry
vests are designed to protect from rifles.  Usually
when a vest is rated to protect from a rifle, like say
a .308 (a common sniper round) they mean from 100 or 200
yds away, now at point blank range.

ok that concludes tonights lesson on bullet proof vests.
i sure hope u read these things

heartstone doesn't seem to be working quite like the spellcraft
says.  Theres 2 things ive noticed so far.  

#1.  I do not see any forms of healing that don't work.  course the only
ways i know to check are drinking, and slow healing (including using trollish).

cb
#2.  Spellcraft says that heartstone will protect me from slashing and well whatever
it says, it should also be protecting me from wounding damage.  When i kill barbazu
or cornugons with heartstone, i do not take any damage from them but still wind
up with bleeding wounds that i have to quit in order to get rid of.

also, not sure if this is a bug, but i noticed the decatur copbots can hit me despite
the heartstone, but cannot hit through stoneskin, that doesnt make a lot of sense,
what kind of damage do they do with those batons anyway?

alucard knows about sex, but not women.
I explained to nsd that the reason for this (cause she pointed it out to me)
ce
was that alucard was modeled after Nightmask.  Which meant, his 
'fair share' of sex came mostly from camels ... and some of it came from
getting pounded by other men.

anyway, i think u should change his asks to reflectr this.  if he has
ch
to knwo about women then mebbe he should just say 'fuck em and chuck em, thats what
I say'

heh

oh and when u ask hiom about camels, sheep, chickens, or bestiality, perhaps he should

alucard shouls tell a joke, say when u ask him about jokes.

heres 1 for him.

One day Nightmask and Deviant were walking through a field when they
came across a little sheep with its head caught in a barbed wire fence.

The sheep was just struggling trying to get out .. going 'maaAAAA, MAAAAAAAA'

Nightmask said, 'Hey deviant, we should help that little guy.'  But diviant
said wait, not just yet, lets have some fun.'  So deviant pulls down his pants
and starts screwing the snot out of the lamb.  The whole time the lambs just sitting
there going 'maaAAaaaa, MAAAAAA' (thats sposed to be a sheep sound in case u dont
recognize it, hes not calling for his momma).  Anyway, when deviant gets through,
he looks over at Nightmask and says, 'So, u want a piece of this before we
free him?'  

Nightmask goes, 'Sure!' and he gets down on all 4's, sticks his head in the
fence and starts going 'maaAAAA, MAAAAA'

To this day, Nightmask still has scars on the side of his neck where the barbed
wire rubbed against his skin.

Is this the way that things are supposed to happen? Even if a player logs off

Bug : Hoss at Sat Mar  4 04:51:31 2000 in /d/Planar/Baator/minauros/city15
ok, did more research on the bug from earlier.

it appears to be from foresight.

if i have foresight active and attack anything, foresight tries to fire off twice
and the monster cant hit me, while i am able to attack him. 

If I cast a spell on him, he will start to attack me again.
I think fi i command my pet to attack, he will attack the pet and when hes done
with the pet he will attack me.

also, if i leave the room and come back, he doesnt attack me.

dude, im dyin here, i wanna abuse this soooo bad and kill tiamat.  But, i know 
thats uncool, its not how i do business.  Here's how i do bidness, ive 
reported this bug .... now all i got to do is wait for u to log on at least once
then i can use the hell outta it till u get it fixed.

Bug : Hoss at Sat Mar  4 04:59:57 2000 in /d/Planar/Baator/minauros/city15
for the record .. heres how i think foresight should work, this should
fix the aforementioned bug.  I think it should only fire off
when you are attacked.  Its kinda lame the way it works now.  I mean think aboiut it,
its supposed to be a protection from pk, and if i was going to pk someone, id prolly
wait till they were killing a monster or right after they wimpied from one.  In
that instance, foresight wouldnt do ya a dam bit of good.  It would even be allright
if it only fired off in pk, so the shadow warriors autoing me when i walk in wouldnt
set it off.


ok lesse now, i need 3 mil to level ... tiamat is worth 200k ... so id need to kill
her 15 times.  Holy geez thats gunna take forever with no spells.  I bet my
weapons wont even hit her, but rest assured i will find a way.  

Oh scuze me, my mind was wandering, ignore that last part

but anyway, i can get to the sanctuary with the ancient gold ring even from

Personally, i think u should just leave this, soince there are only 3 charges
in the ring and its not really all that east to get, and in fact im pretty sure
im the only one who even knows where it is, and i dont tell people where
the secret stuff is.  But, i had to report it to keep my conciense clear.

I get a message quite often in combat that says 'you hit criticlally' or
something like that. I would think that this would mean I do the maximum amount
of dammage for that particular attack. However, according to the dammage message I recieve for the very next line
I am NOT getting the max dammage message of KNOCKS THE SHIT blah...

Any thoughts<?

I feel that very powerfull things like Dispater's staff for example should not
be sold at the shop, but instead 'hide the valuable item away
 or something...

Just my 2 cents. Yes i know this should have been an 'Idea' but i hit
the wrong dam report. so sue me....

To Nightmask:  RE: Sharpshooters...

	My idea is that we get some kind of 'Spell' and i use the term loosely
that allows us to have greater accuracy when using a weapon befitting
our guild. ie: when I wield a 'gun' I can cast an accuracy spell that gives me
bonuses to hit and to dammage for the durration of the 'spell'. 

Just my 2 cents,

Players and wizzes shouldn't be allowed to dammage/take dammage from each other
this is, in my opinion, a rather large bug.  I was testing it out last night
and I actualy was hurting and almost killing a wizard, who at this time will

once players reach level 25 or something they have been playing the mud for
quite some time. That much time spent in one place tends to give
one a rather unique attachment to that place.  think that players over a certain
level , no matter what class they are, should be able to
'mark' one spot on the mud as their 'home base' so that they can 'teleport' to
that one place by expending some energy of some kind.
Obviously this will have little effect on mages who already have teleport
but for those of us who DONT this would be invaluable.

there is an emote mock that is listed in the emotes list, however, it is a skill that only thieves can use
using the thief skill ventriloquism. I think that the semote list should be
updated to reflect the removal of the 'mock' emote.

when you sit on the hammock, it says "sit down in" instead of "sit
down on"   and the commands are a little weird. For example:
You don't "sit hammock", you "sit on hammock". Same on 'flop' and
'swing'.  Change them to "flop on hammock"... ah wait, swing you can
change it to simply "swing" instead of "swing hammock". And include
the 'swing' command in the item desc for the hammock. Just a few 
suggestions from someone that knows an awful lot and needs to transfer
that knowledge to whomever. I'm not gonna last forever.

pets are fucked up.  I cant make them invisibile anymore (that might be
a fuckup with invisible though)  And I cannot make my frostguard equip the shield 
cb

he was cloned with, and he will not drop it so i can check it out, AND he will
not drop his axe either.

Ok, it appears that the hide and backstab commands under thelp does not work.  When you type backstab, it gives the '
You're not hidden...  that target will see you coming!' message and when you hide, it does say you hide but you can not backstab as it gives you the same message.   According to the thelp, a thief can hide and backstab both at level 1.

In the sewers, the description reads:  the smell is horendous.   The correct spelling of the word is HORRENDOUS.   I checked it against Webster's as well.

Ok, again in the sewers.   The next line:  hope its just water.   Websters and I agree it should be IT'S, the contraction for it is.
