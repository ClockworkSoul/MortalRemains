mesg "WOAH!!!  That's some heavy stuff.  I don't know if I told you or not.  I think I tried to warn you about mudding being addictive.  I let it ruin my life 7 years ago and I'm still paying for it and will pay for about 10 more years probably.  *takes a deep breath*I'm trying to think of something to say, but there isn't anything I can say to help you out.  The only thing I can say is this.  As far as trying to keep in contact with me you can just use ICQ and e-mail.  That way your not 'mudding'.  I know it's not much different and he would probably say that, just limit your time on right now.  I mean I could if I wanted to stay up all night and code and mud in the mornings.  You notice I don't.  I've got a limited handhold on my addiction.  Kinda like cigarettes.  I used to smoke almost 2 packs a day.  Now I smoke less then 1 pack.  Not to mention the fact that on the 28th of this month I will be celebrating my 3 yr anniversary of being clean from drugs.Mainly though you were spending WAY to much time on.  I didn't say anything, cuz it's not my place.  I'm sorry that he felt he had to give an ultimatum.  They never work out good.  Discussion's work great.  Ultimatum's NEVER end good.  Take at least a week off the computer, almost completely.  Mebbe just check e-mail and ICQ messages, but only once a day.  You two deffinately need to seek a councelor though.  I know they are expensive, but they have ways of pointing things out to BOTH of you that doesn't always upset each one.  Sometimes though, the saying 'Truth hurts' happens though.What ever you do though.  Try to work it out.  I'd hate to see you loose your marriage.  I know you love him.  I can tell by the way you talk about him.  Kinda like I talk about Cindy.  Even though I won't admit the L word.   ;-PI better let you go though, cuz I know you need to stay off as much as possible.  Please be careful and good luck though hun.Best wishes,Lord Nemar Tel'Narin."
