You are in a chamber of death, the smell of old, dead things accompany
your heavy breathing, and the weight of something else rests on your soul.
A dessicated corpse lies here, in the center of a circle of salt. This
circle you have seen before, it is a circle ward, it is used to prevent
demons and other hellspaun from entering and disturbing its bones. one of
the more interesting things however is the blue light hovering above the
corpse. You haven't seen that before though.
