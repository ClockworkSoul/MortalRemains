mesg "2 questions if ya don't mind..woops nope..3:)1...tell me something cause i don't know you well enough to guess...when you say \"tell me about it\" and \"i want to get to know you better\"...do you want honest real answers or is it like when you ask \"how are you?\" to a person but don't really want an answer?2...when you first met me here you said you were interested in me...now that you know me better and the novelty has worn off..are you still? (honest answer pls)3. this one is totally separate from number 2 ...what are you doing for holidays/new years 2000?blood and greb and wife and val are hopefully coming to visit and if you'd like to come i would like you to visit too:)would have asked you this all in person but i never seem to catch you onhope all is well with you hons"
