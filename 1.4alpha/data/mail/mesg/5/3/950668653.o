mesg "hey man, this place has more bugs than the bible has psalms ... did youknow that?  Well now ya do.heres the latest bug ....I just tried to log in and instead of going to the starting point .. i went to whatappeared to be the void.  I think the desc just said it was a void there was nothingto see here.  But there were no exits.  I tried to shout, but i got a message like'your shout was swallowed up by the void'  I dunno whare i was, but i think iveseen the void here before, and thats not what i remembered.  Anyway, i tried to castsome spells to get out, i kept getting errors.  Cant rememebr what they were.but they mighta been the 'can't load because no effective user' one.  I get thatone a lot BTW ... best i can tell, when ive gotten that error on the past, it wasbecause i was trying to teleport to a room that probablyt hadnt been loaded intomemory ... anyway, that was kind of an aside, look into it when u get a chance.Back to the big problem.  Anyway, I tried logging on twice, to no avail .. BTW I couldntquit either, i got the c-ya messsage but thats it.  Umm, no spells worked, i got an error message every time.  Anyway, I decided to try logging in a new character.So i created Knightmare, and he logged in with no problem.  If im not allowedto have doubles ... go ahead and dest KM, if i am allowed ... keep him, ill playhim as a priest when yer ready.  So anyway, after i logged in, i saw Steel and NSDwere here.  Steel said he just got here, prolly right b4 i first tried to login, and NSD said shed been here for a long time.  Thought i didnt see either of themon the login screen, nor on the who while i was in the void.  I talked to NSD, she suggested i try again, and shed try to watch for me etc... This time i logged in hosswith no problem .. well no problem except i fiftn have any of my autoloads excpet formy sig item.  SO bottom line, Im missing my spellbook, highlighter, and whatever else autoloads on me.and i dont like the computer fuickuing with me when i log in.  Let me know what u find dude-thanks-hoss"
