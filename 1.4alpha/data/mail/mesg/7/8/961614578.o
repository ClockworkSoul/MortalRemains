mesg "Hmm sounds very interesting... 	Everything and anything that pertains to ruls and regulations would haveto be reviewed by me, and obvously any questions I have would go directly through you and chronos, or just you I dont care :)  that does sound pretty good. Now you know im not the greatest coder here soas far as QC goes, were talking making sure the i's are dotted and the t's arecrossed, and that everything is oganized in a fassions suitable to the domain they are coding for.But to sum up , cause I know im rambling and its hard doing email whenI got pets comming in and gossip butting in etc...I think I would like it and if you are wililng to give it a try thenso am i.  BTW still no word on the rest of my rooms, but I can send you what I have. You want them emailed to you in notepad format? this way it might be easy for you to slip them into the lib and then I can work them up to this MUD's standars and format.Bomber"
