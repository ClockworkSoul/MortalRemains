Dwarves are short, stocky fellows, easily identified by their size and
shape. They average 4 to 4 1/2 feet tall. They have ruddy cheeks, dark
eyes, and dark hair.

Dwarves are ill-disposed toward magic and have little talent for it, but
revel in fighting, warcraft, and scientific arts such as engineering.

Because of their sturdy builds, dwarves add 1 to their initial 
Constitution scores. Their dour and suspicious natures cause them to
subtract 1 from their initial Charisma scores.
