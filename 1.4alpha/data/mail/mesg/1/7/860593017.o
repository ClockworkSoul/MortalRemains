mesg "Okay...  here's how were going to to weapon now.Weapon class no longer exists. We now use a function called set_weapon().  It works as follows:set_weapon(int magic, int to_hit_bonus, int damage_bonus);Real easy...   if a weapon is magical you put the + rating in themagic spot, and the to hit and damage bonuses are automagicallyfigured out. If you want special bonuses (say a non-magical woodsword) You would put the appropriate bonuses/penalties in the appropriate places.Example 1 - A standard +3 weapon:	set_weapon(3);Example 2 - A standard non-magical weapon:	set_weapon() or set_weapon(0);Example 3 - A high-quality, but nonmagical weapon with, say, a +1   modifier to hit and damage:	set_weapon(0, 1, 1);Example 4 - A wooden weapon with -1 to hit, and -1 to damage:	set_weapon(0, -1, -1);I'm sure you get the point by now.  Any questions, please postthem on the new Mudlib board south of the start room...					-CyanideCode on."
