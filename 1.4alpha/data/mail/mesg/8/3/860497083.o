mesg "Zur,	This mud was originally going to be a pk mud from the start,and I am not going to change this.	There will, however, be a few locical limitations to keepthe entire game from degenerating into an utter melee.  	I have played on many muds that do have pk, where the playerswho were obnoxious simply ceased to exist.  By the way, the first law I gave Nightmask to enforce was that reckless slaughter of playerswithout any cause was simply illegal, and cause for nuking.	Personally, I find it more obnoxious than anything to havea player standing infront of you, saying nasty shit about your lineage,and you being powerless to do anything about it...						-Cyanide"
