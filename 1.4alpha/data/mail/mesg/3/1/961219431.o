mesg "I know that I have not done my coding quotas as I'm supposed to, I thought it will be fun to code again, but I just can't find thetime to do so anymore. I can't be sitting on a chair codin all day.If I log in again I don't think it will be to code anymore so, please, feel free to erase any directory that I might have left, they are incomplete and obvioulsy there will be no need for them.I might log in as a regular player, and don't worry, I won't askyou to \"promote\" me because I really don't want to.Sincerely,Dreams"
