remain ({"shana",})
mesg "Shana,     I've been checking over my data, and it would seem that thelast time you worked on your area was on the 30th of January, almost 2 weeks ago.  As I look further, it would seem that your area consists of almost 40 identical rooms.     In effect, you've really only coded a single room since youwere wizzed on the 23rd of January.     The process of learning how to code is difficult, and it isvery important to try new things and new code. If there is no activity in the next week or so, we will be forced to revoke yourwizard status.          -Cyanide"
