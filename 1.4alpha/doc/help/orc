Orcs resemble primative humans, with gray-green skin and coarse hair. They
stoop slightly, have low, jutting foreheads, snouts, canine teeth, and 
short pointed ears. They stand between five and a half and six feet tall,
and often have powerful, stocky builds. 

Orcs respect skill in battle, and from time to time an orc champion 
approaches human standards of bravery and honor in battle. 

Orcs receive a +1 bonus to their initial Strength value, but their
appearance and savagery gives the a -2 to Charisma.
