mesg "in the room desc of the pit of flame it says it costs 50,000 coins and 20,000 xp.  When i tried it, it dod not take the xp from me, just the coinage.For the record, i think its a lot more fair like it is.  Perhaps make it soit can take 50,000 coins OR 20,000 xp.  Since it only gives you 1 hp i think chargingboth coins and xp it too high a price, for that price it needs to at least giveyou like a 4d5 advance or something.  -hosschoh yeah, and please mail me as soon as you change it, specially if it takes youcea long time, cause if i get a few million coins to blow and you haven't gotten aroundto fixin this im liable to give em all to the demons."
