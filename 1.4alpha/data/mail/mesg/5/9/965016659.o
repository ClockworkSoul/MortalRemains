mesg "HiI just wanted to let you know, I'vebeen called in to worktomorrow morning. We have an emergency staff meeting that is mandatory forall teachers. I will try to get on in the early part of the afternoon sowe can finish our discussion. Please understand... this is NOT an attemptto delay the conversation... I just found out about the meeting at 9:30this evening.You can chose to believe me or not, but it is the truth. I don't know whenin the afternoon I will be able to log on or if I will be able to accessAOL. I did want to leave you this mail so you would not think that I wasskipping out on you.thank you for your understanding in advance.Your FriendChuck (Shallar)"
