mesg "i have an idea for a new spellit is called earthmoveas we necros are close to the very ground with which we obtain all of our powers.... we should be able to travel through the very ground itself at a cost of 10 sp per movememnhere are some examplescast earthmove northif normal movement is possible in that direction you would absorb yourself into the ground and move through the ground northone would use this spell to spell to move past monsters which you wimpied from but are now trapped etc.....so lets say i was fighting tiamatand i wimpied north well i'd be.... hmmm lucky to had`ve had a chance to wimpy... and also very much stuck... so i would earthmove south then earthmove south agin then i would use the emerge command to thats right emerge myself from the ground itself and regain my character form.here are some of the messages players would seeCreed makes a motion with her hand and dissolves into the ground.Creed forms herself from the very ground you walk on.neat huh?see what i can do on my 1.5 hour commute into work.. was listening to metallica ride the lightning album  at the time.well i hope you like it all the players will want to get into this guild man it is fun being a necro!say so earthmove actially now that i think about it.....cast earthmove you absorb into the groundthen just move around like normalyou will get the message you move through the ground northyou move through the ground east etc.then when you want to emerge from the ground just type emergeso emerge will cost 100 sp to castnothing to emergeok laterzCreed"
