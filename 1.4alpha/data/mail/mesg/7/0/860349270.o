mesg "I realize that player killing is a big part of realism on a mud.But, we aren't dealing with reality here. We are dealing with amud. Players that come to pk muds are mostly arrogant and obnoxious.There are alternatives to legalizing player killing. We could havean assassin's guild, wherein you can an enormous fee to have a playerknocked off. Or we could have a justice department that will attackthe player that pk'd, if they survive the battle, then they get awaywith it.I feel very strongly on the subject of pk. I never even wiz on playerkilling muds. I wouldn't feel very comfortable here if it were a PKmud. So I am asking you to reconsider this.Zur."
