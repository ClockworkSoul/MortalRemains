hi there
well, i am not sure what else to say other then what you will be reading below
i think best says how i am feeling, its valentines day, and a girl like you
doesn't deserve to go without something special.  you have been kind
caring, patient, and a good friend, and maybe just maybe, more.
i tried to find things that best expressed my varried emotions.
but the one thing i would like to make clear, is tthat i care about you, a lot.

                                      
My tears are falling into empty space
the silent call of my longing
does not trigger an echo
What is tearing me apart- so softly?

In long years of painful trouble
I have learned to live the- YES
to find then in this unlimited- YES,
as well - the inevitable NO

My doing was the result of affirmation
creative forces were triggered by impulses
The significance of "doing" melts away -
emptiness is left

And through comes a new being
with alert longing in his heart:
for joy, for togetherness - in ampleness
- to be completed with a YOU - in love

I am not a timeless-spaceless point in the universe,
weightless, suspended in space
one and complete by itself
Where ever I am coming from, I am related to earth.

Can I go further forward on this ground
then by surrendering without reserve?
If nothing reflects me - sustains me
the connecting cord with earthen matter melts away

Is there an ancient blend of blaze to be completed?
This is my silent call of longing: to unite with YOU!
Is there a being, who might reply to an echo?

A clear voice appears very near to me:
"Your call finds an echo in my heart -
I will come to you!"

Is it YOU or just my wish which fools me?
Whatever - all abilities are there
this is a step - a movement of my wings in flight

                                      
She comes to me as I sleep.
She enters my thoughts, and my dreams.
Who is this Woman, this Woman I see?
She stands there, looking over me.

She speaks to me,
  her voice so beautiful and sweet.
She reaches out and touches me,
  with her hands....softly.
Her lips upon mine.
I move closer...
  her heart next to mine.

The scent of roses is in the air.
I awaken, no one is here.
Alone again, in the dark.
A hopeless broken heart
How I wish to be free,
  with you next to me.

We could soar to great heights,
  like an arrow in flight.
No longer would I be,
  alone in the night.
This moment shall last forever,
  the day we are together.

We will love, we will cherish
The feelings will never perish.
Until then she is here,
In my thoughts, in my dreams.
This Woman, this Woman I see...
Will she ever be a part of me?

                                      
from far away i watch you
as you perfect my favorite view
it's almost as if i painted it
with inspiration from you

A priceless ruby that melts in the sea
wouldn't mean a thing
but while you're there to compliment it
i hear the night air sing

as the ocean's nightly blanket
sweeps upon the shores
i watch in admiration
every smile and step of yours

the arrival of the moon
means i must sadly leave
but with tomorrow's grace at dusk
my view i shall retrieve

the twinkling stars i envy
for they can stay with you
but with their help tomorrow's sky
will be a cloudless blue

nature's portrait seems incomplete
it seems in some way shamed
but if i was a part of it
this painting would be framed

                                      
Your heart I will steal.
Then your heart I will heal.
Get rid of all your doubts and fears,
all your pains and tears.
Show you a love that is real
show you what it is to feel.
Feel happiness,
Joy,
and bliss.
Treat you the way they should have.
Treat you better than they ever could have.
To find someone special, is what you're wishin'.
To win your heart... is my mission.
