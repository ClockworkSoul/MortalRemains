mesg "OK bro. MAde what I want to be the portal key for my area. The fileis  /d/Prime/Krynn/armor/pendant.c  If possible I would like it so that it has to be worn i order to work. Since I am not sure how to dothat I will let you tak care of it, or just tell me what I need to doto it.  >;)  The area is not 100% finished, but I figure let them wonderaroiund a few and that wa ythe players can at least tell me what theythink so far and maybe give me a few more ideas and such  >;) Thanksduder. Enjoy.DracPorn Peddler of Krynn"
