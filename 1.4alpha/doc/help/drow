Drow are a sub-race of elves who long ago escaped great wars by fleeing
underground. Most drow appear much like elves, but are somewhat taller, 
and possess jet-black skin.

A side-effect of the drow's existance in the Underdark is their ability of
'magic resistance'. At low levels, such resistance is small, but as the 
drow grows in power, so does his ability to resist spells.

Unfortunately, drow who become mages or priests must learn to purge this
ability to pursue the magical arts. They do not have magic resistance.

Drow with magic resistance suffer a small penalty to their accumulated 
experience, advancing about 10& slower than their non-drow counterparts.

As drow are elves, they inherit the standard elven +1 to Dexterity and -1
to Constitution. Additionally, the harsh culture and lifestyle of the drow
instills great cunning, but stunts their inter-personal skills. As such, 
they receive a -1 to Charisma, and a +1 to Intelligence.
