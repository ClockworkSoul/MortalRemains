This ability allows a Sharpshooter to attempt
to assassinate a target with a single shot.  The
chance of hitting and the damage done increase
as you gain levels.  You may only attempt a
headshot on a target once, and if it misses or
does not kill the target, it will become enraged
(of course) and attempt to kill you.
